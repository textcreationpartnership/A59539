            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY Lady <hi>P.</hi> acquainted me 'twas your Deſire, which is ſtill to me a Command, that I ſhould ſend you this ſmall Book of Diſcourſes and Eſſays: And tho' I know many of the Subjects they treat of to be light and trivial, yet I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concluded, tho' none of theſe Diſcourſes are worthy your reading, yet all your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are worthy my obeying; and I had much rather the World ſhould know I write ill, than you, Madam, ſhould have the leaſt thought I obey you ſo.</p>
            <p>And I humbly beg you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Madam, that I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you this Book upon any dependency <hi>I</hi> have of it's merit,
<pb facs="tcp:38135:3"/>but meerly to publiſh the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations I owe you, which I muſt ever want ability to requite, but ſhall never lack juſtice to acknowledge.</p>
            <p>And I hope, Madam, you will be the more eaſily perſwaded to pardon this great confidence, when you conſider that ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt now governs this World; and ſince a a King can raiſe and illuſtrate one of his meaneſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and render him Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by declaring him ſuch; ſo, Madam, tho' this is one of the meaneſt Books Dedicated to you, yet if you will be pleaſed to raiſe and honour it with your counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it cannot but thrive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo great &amp; noble a Patronage.</p>
            <p>And pray, Madam, do not think I write this Book out of any hope to ſhew ſome Wit, when really I never ſo much as thought of it; but meerly to
<pb facs="tcp:38135:3"/>publiſh the great honour I have for you, and how humble a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant I am to you. And you know, Madam, 'tis as well a Mark of Sovereignty to have one's Image ſtampt upon a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as a Guinea, the meanneſs of it's value, nor the ſmallneſs of it's Image, not at all leſſening the great power of the Prince it repreſents.</p>
            <p>No more can I, Madam, by placing your great Name to this ſmall Book, in which your Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues being only meanly ſet off and painted but in Dead colours, can leſſen and eclipſe your high worth and ſplendid merits</p>
            <p>I know, Madam, there are many great Ladies that keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in the Root the Title of their noble and ancient Families; but indeed there are very few that now-a-days bring any addition of Honour to their Houſe: But
<pb facs="tcp:38135:4"/>all know, Madam, that you not only keep alive in the Root, but your Merits ſpring, and flouriſh in all your Actions, both to your own, and Families Great Honour and Reputation; for you not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly live to the height of greatneſs that any of the Engliſh Nobility now do, but to the height of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that any of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ever did; for you make it your great delight to read God's Laws, and your main concern to keep his Commandments, never ſtriving to procure a high place in Court, but to ſecure a good one in Heaven; ſtill court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good, not the great; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver flattering the powerful, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways praiſing the Virtuous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only a Servant to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, and not Courtier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like an humble Servant in Words to all, ſcarce in deed a true Friend to any, who ſeldom ſpeak
<pb facs="tcp:38135:4"/>what they think, and rarely perform what they promiſe; their words being commonly, not the Interpreters, but Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſers of their Thoughts.</p>
            <p>But, Madam, you ſtill kept your ſelf in a kind of religious retirement, out of the falſe and glittering Scenes of the Court; and not only from the common Vices and Vanities of <hi>England,</hi> but from the Foppiſh Modes, &amp; high Extravagances of <hi>France,</hi> which were juſt upon being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliz'd here in <hi>England.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you differ from moſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for they love much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Praiſes, but ſtrive little to deſerve them; but you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſtrive to deſerve them, but love not to receive them; your great Humility adding a luſtre to your high Quality, and your high Quality, adding a luſtre to your true Humility, and a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb facs="tcp:38135:5"/>too; for God ſtill gives Grace to the humble.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here trouble you much, Madam, with a Character of the vain idle Vitioſo Fopps of our time, nor here make it my buſineſs to ſet out the vain modiſh Ladies of our age, ſince both make it their main con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to ſet out themſelves, tho' in a very bad Figure; but my deſign here is, that becauſe I did in my Youth perſwade ſome young Wives to do what they ought not, I would now in my old age perſwade all young Wives and Women to do what they ought, which is, <hi>To remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their Creator in the Days of their Youth,</hi> and to ſtrive more for the true laſting Beauty of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, than the ſlight fading one of a fine Face, which is only a meer out-ſide Beauty; but the Beauty of Holineſs is like
<pb facs="tcp:38135:5"/>the King's Daughter, all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious within, which will bring one an agreeable ſatisfaction whilſt one lives, and a ſweet peace of Conſcience when one Dies: The other, but high and proud vain thoughts whilſt her Beauty lives; and ſad Frettings and Diſcontents, when ſhe finds it dies; for uſually as the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes Beauty leaves her, ſo her Lovers Love leaves him; for Effects will follow their Cauſe.</p>
            <p>And tho' many of the vain Modiſh Ladies are guilty of Pride, Vanity, and perhaps what's worſe than both, yet moſt of them are ſo ſelf-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their own merit, as they had rather judg the World Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious, than themſelves faulty; like the Philoſopher, that loſt his ſight, and yet would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve himſelf blind, but that the Room was Dark.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:38135:6"/>
            <p>And now, Madam, being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of my Letter, I ſhall ſpeak as all Chriſtians do, or at leaſt ought to do, at the ending of their Lives, which is, to ſpeak the truth from the bottom of their Heart, as I am ſure I now do, by ſaying, your Virtuous Life, exemplary Piety, and your extraordinary Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is not like that of moſt great Ladies, whoſe boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty extends no farther than to that great Friend, or this near Kinſman, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more to inlarge their own fame, than to relieve his wants, and ſo ſavours more of Vain Glory, than true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: But, Madam, your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is ſo generally good, and bountifully great, as none need a better Title to it, than that of having a great need of it. In a word, Madam, your
<pb facs="tcp:38135:6"/>whole Life has been a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Series of noble and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions, which has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd your Fame ſo compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excellent, as you are not only an honour to your Name, but a credit to your Sex, and a comfort to both rich and poor about you, for you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the great by your extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Civility, and relieve the poor by your abundant Charity.</p>
            <p>Madam, your trouble of reading this Letter being now near at an end 'tis full time that my Apology for giving it you ſhould now begin; and becauſe 'tis a good ſaying I much like and follow, That plain dealing is ſtill the beſt Policy, Truth being ever pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctur'd naked, I ſhall tell you here, Madam, the plain and naked Truth how your Name
<pb facs="tcp:38135:7"/>came to be plac'd in the Front of this little Book.</p>
            <p>When my Lady <hi>P</hi>—acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me you deſired to ſee it, ſhe in a Rallying manner, bid me ſend it you with a fine <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle Dedicatory;</hi> and I, in a like Rallying manner, told her I would; and preſently writ thus far of this Letter: But upon my word, Madam, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thought or deſign, that it ſhould ever come to your ſight, much leſs to publick view: For aſſoon as I had writ it, I reſolved never to ſhew it, or look on it more: But being to buy the ſecond part of this Book to ſend a Friend, whoſe Servant ſtay'd purpoſely for it, after I had given it him, and he was gone, talking with the Book-Binder, he told me, he had very near ſold all my Books; upon which <hi>I</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:38135:7"/>him one, but it ſeems <hi>I</hi> had unfortunately forgot that I had left this Letter in the Book which I ordered to be carried to him; and he finding this Letter dedicated to your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, knowing the high Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and great Eſteem all have for you, concluded, That your Name in the Front of this Book, muſt needs ſtamp a Value on it, and breed a Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity in many for it, and ſo Printed this Letter and placed my Name to it, conſidering on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own profit by Printing it, not your trouble in reading it, or my diſcredit in owning it. Aſſoon as I heard of it, I went immediately much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and ſurpris'd, to the Book-binder, who deſired me not to be ſo much concern'd, for there were very few, if any, of the Books were ſold that
<pb facs="tcp:38135:8"/>had this Letter Dedicatory to your Ladyſhip Printed to them, they being but juſt come out of the Preſs, and that for paying his Charges for Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, he would deliver me them all, which I readily conſented to, and came a few days after to receive them; but this Book-binder was gone out of the World, and by his Death, my Book was diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in it, paſt all poſſibility of recalling.</p>
            <p>This is, Madam, the plain truth, how your Name comes to be placed now in the Front of this little Book, when it was Printed ſome few Years before, without any Name to it at all; and that your Name is now, I am much aſham'd of and humbly beg your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> have, Madam, in writing
<pb facs="tcp:38135:8"/>theſe Diſcourſes, made it my great concern to avoid all Roads and Paths that Eſſays uſually Travel in, and treat of; but really Virgin-Themes, and freſh Proviſion of Wit is now ſo fearce to find, that many of our beſt Writers, and greateſt Scholars are often forc'd to uſe cold Repetition Meats, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh out their Books, as well as good Houſe-keepers are cold Meats to ſet out their Tables. And tho' good Cooks can make ſeveral ſorts of Diſhes out of one kind of Meat, yet they cannot with all their skill, make one Diſh to pleaſe all Palats, like the delightful <hi>Manna</hi> in the Wilderneſs, that gave a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Guſto anſwerable to every <hi>Iſraelite's</hi> differing Taſte: No more can one ſort of Writing ſuit the Fancy of all kinds of Readers. <hi>I</hi> am ſure <hi>I</hi> do not
<pb facs="tcp:38135:9"/>expect theſe Diſcourſes ſhould pleaſe any one, they being Dull, and moſt of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects they write of, Light al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as very Light, as the airy Ladies they treat of, and are deſigned for; and therefore I am ſo far from pretending in the leaſt, to any of my readers Praiſes, as <hi>I</hi> expect none from any, but beg pardon of all: And I truly wiſh this Book may perſwade the vain young Ladies to beg God's: And that as <hi>I</hi> deſire my Readers excuſe for my dull Writing, they may their Maker's Pardon, for their vain living. <hi>I</hi> am ſure I am doubly bound to beg your Ladyſhip's, both for giving you the trouble of reading this Book, and aſſuming the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of placing your Name, tho' undeſignedly, to it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:38135:9"/>
            <p>But I will add no Excuſes, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Concluſion to a dull long Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſtill the beſt Complement; I am ſure, Madam, 'tis the only one I can ever juſtly pretend to make you, your Merits being much above all my Praiſes. I wiſh I could as truly ſay, That your whole Life were above all ſorts of Troubles, that your reading this might not prove one to you; but as 'tis fooliſh to fear what's unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſo 'tis to wiſh for Impoſſibilities, ſince the moſt great, the moſt virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the moſt happy in this World are not free from Troubles, becauſe they cannot be free'd from Sin; we are all unavoidable Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to it, being all born in an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſervitude to Sin, without any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain meaſure, or exact number.</p>
            <p>But tho' the miſery of Sinning is unavoidable, yet we ought to make our ſelves as Spiritually wiſe, and Worldly happy as we are able, that is, make our Sins as few, and all our
<pb facs="tcp:38135:10"/>Troubles (except for our Sins) as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as we can; and therefore, Madam, to make your Trouble the leſs in looking this over, I ſhall deſire you to read it, but juſt after the rate I writ it, which was, when I had nothing elſe to do. And for all my other Readers, I only deſire they will uſe theſe Diſcourſes, no worſe than moſt do maim'd Beggars, that is, though they want the Charity to relieve their Wants, yet not ſo to abound in ill Nature, as to jeer at their Defects: This is all I expect from them, and this is all, Madam, I humbly beg of you, That you will pleaſe to pardon this poor Book's Faults, and not jeer at its Defects, which ſhall ever be an Obligation placed on,</p>

                  <hi>THE FIRST DISCOURSE,</hi> Of ſome of the common ways many vertuous Wives take to loſe their Reputation, tho' they keep their Chaſtity; being vertuous in their inward Intentions, but indiſcreet in their Talk and outward Actions; and Men judge by what they ſee, not by what Women ſay they mean.</head>
               <p>I Shall not here, Reader, pretend to preſent you with the Sum Total of the numerous and various Ways, many handſom Women take to be ill talk'd of, for that I am ſure would be a Task as much above my Power to write, as I fancy 'twould be above, your Patience to read; and he that can perform that great work, muſt need at leaſt a Prophet's Knowledge, and a <hi>Job</hi>'s Patience; and truly I pretend to neither: Nor have I ſo much as a Thought of undertaking ſingly to tell you all the Faults, Arts, Deceits and Indiſcretions of all Wives, much leſs of all Women, ſince I fancy if all the Husbands in the whole World were aſſembled in one general Council, they could no more ſum up all their Wive's Faults, than cure all their Vices; for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are ceas'd to the whole World, but the Papiſt, of whoſe Faith, I thank God I am not of:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38135:12"/>But of this opinion I am, that 'tis ſufficient for every Married Man to carry his own Burden and Proportion, in the Matrimonial Yoke, with Diſcretion and Patience; which latter is a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, their Wives will be ſure to make them practiſe, if they be not more fortunate, than the generality of Husbands are, and I think ever will be, if one may judge of the future by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>I ſhall name but few, and write but little of the many, and ſeveral ways, diverſe virtuous (I do not ſay diſcreet) Wives take to be ill talked of, and ſhall here skip troubling you with a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a vile ſort of ſcandalous Wives, that are commonly known, and publickly branded for ſuch, who have, by their wicked Lives, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd themſelves ſo contemptible, as they are to be us'd by all vertuous Women, as we do perſons infected with the Plague: We are not bound to go ſee how they do, but we are oblig'd to avoid coming where they are, both for our own ſake, and the ſake of others; and to remember to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Solomon</hi>'s good Advice as to a vertuous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's carriage towards an ill ſcandalous Woman, <hi>Remove thy way far from her, and come not near the door of her Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are a ſort of beaſtly Women, that take upon them the vile employment of common cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring, and publick rayling at all ſtrict Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Women, arming themſelves with downright Impudence, having loſt all their ſhame with their Vertue; for they that part with the one, ſoon caſts off the other: And becauſe they have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd themſelves contemptible by their ill Lives, they ſtrive to make good Women appear bad by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38135:12"/>their foul Tongues, ſcandalizing the Vertues by all the ill Reports they can invent, being like thoſe <hi>Solomon</hi> names, <hi>Who cannot ſleep without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done ſome miſchief,</hi> being ſo abominably bad, as their very Parents (for Friends they have none) want Confidence to excuſe them, and they Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to juſtify themſelves. Theſe Herd of beaſtly Women, the Vertuous are bound in Charity to pity their bad Condition, but in Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſhun their ill Company; and ſo I'll leave them with a red Croſs on their Door, and a <hi>Lord have mercy on their bad lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt ſort of Wives I ſhall here name, and but name, are a kind of Wives that have the Happineſs to be thought vertuous by many, but the Unhappineſs to be eſteem'd vain and indiſcreet by moſt; they are careful to keep themſelves Chaſt, but careleſs of what others ſay againſt their being ſo; and becauſe they think they do no ill, value not what ill others ſay they do, which is but a ſad ſort of Logick, and an ill way of managing their Reputation; ſince tho' a Wive's Innocency may ſatisfy her own Conſcience, yet it cannot protect her Husband's Honour, nor ſecure her own, ſince publick Cenſure may blemiſh both, if an outward diſcreet carriage doth not prevent: Therefore, doubtleſs, a Wife, who is truly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and truly deſires to be eſteem'd ſuch, is as much concern'd in Honour to keep a good Name, as ſhe is bound in Conſcience to lead a good Life; and the Wife which in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, values little what others ſay, ſeldom care; much what ſhe her ſelf doth, for what bad Cenſures ſhe caſts on others, or others caſt on her; and a Wife or Woman of that ill Temper
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38135:13"/>uſually loves more to commit a hundred faults, than to repent of one, or be told of any; never conſidering that a handſom Woman's leaving a Vice, argues no defect in her Body, but a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous inclination in her Mind: For the very beſt Women in the World are ſubject to Faults and Errors, as well as the worſt, tho' not ſo much; and with this great difference, That a pious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Sins againſt her Will, a wicked Woman with it; in the firſt 'tis but the effects of the Frailty of humane Nature, in the ſecond 'tis the foul Iſſue of vicious Inclinations and habitual Practice. Therefore, 'tis worth ſuch Womens ſtill carrying in their Mind, this uſeful Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, That 'tis always a bad Act, to commit an ill Thing; but never an ill thing, to repent a bad Act; the firſt being the Diſeaſe, the other the Remedy.</p>
               <p>'Tis a certain Truth, That all bad Women de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Cenſure; and, 'tis as great a Truth, that many good Women undergo bad Cenſures, tho' they do not deſerve them; many young Men dealing with handſom Women's Reputation, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did with our bleſſed Saviour, condemn him, tho' he ownd' be found no Fault in him. Indeed the very Air of this Kingdom is ſo infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Nauſeous Diſtemper of Cenſuring, as I fancy 'twill be as impoſſible to ſtop all ill natur'd Tongues from Cenſuring, as to ſtop all handſom Women's Eyes from ſtirring in their Head, or their Blood from running in their Veins; for as long as they move, buſy Cenſurers Tongues will ſtir.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the beſt and moſt likely way I know to prevent others ſpeaking ill of them, is,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38135:13"/>for them not to ſpeak ill of others; for if they do what they ought, you are unjuſt to Cenſure them; and if they do what they ought not, you are unkind to do it; ſince none can do an ill Act, without being puniſh'd by the very Act of doing it; and, therefore, by the Rule of God; Nature and true Charity, pious, vertuous Women, ought rather to be troubled, than pleaſed for the Faults of others, ſince ſhe that is not, doth in ſome degree, make others Faults her own: As on the other Hand, ſhe that ſhews Charity to a Man, doth good to her ſelf, by doing good to him; for Charity to another is Charity to ones ſelf. A vertuous Wife may certainly ſay, ſhe her ſelf is vertuous; but ſhe cannot truly ſay ſuch a Man's Wife is unvertuous, except ſhe certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knows ſhe is ſo; and all know that moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports are falſe: But I am ſure this is a great Truth, That tho' a Wife be never ſo vertuous, yet ſhe ought to be moſt ſtrictly careful, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all others from thinking her the contrary, and to ſhun provoking ill Tongues, as well as committing bad Deeds; ſince many a good ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Woman's Reputation has been by others falſe Tongues ſadly blaſted, and render'd unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, tho' her Life and Carriage has been truly far from being Scandalous or undeſerving; ſo that no Woman ought to be ſo over-puff'd up with the inward knowledg of her Vertue, as to ſlight the outward Care ſhe ought to take, and the prudent Means ſhe is oblig'd to uſe to make all think her vertuous; for tho' ſhe be never truly ſuch, yet ſhe ought to take the ſame care, and uſe the ſame means and method to plant a good Reputation in the World, as good Gardners
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38135:14"/>do in ſetting their Trees in Earth; let the Ground be never ſo good and rich, which is, not to plant them too deep, for then they'l rot; nor yet too ſhallow, for then they'l burn; ſo that a mean between both is to be us'd in the very beſt Ground. So a Woman, tho' never ſo vertuous, ought not to place ſo deep a value on her own Reputation, as thereby to undervalue that of others; nor ſo debaſe herſelf and leſſen her own Character, as to plant too ſhallow an Eſteem on her own Worth; for then all others will be ſure to do the like by her own Example; very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably concluding, That ſhe ought beſt to know her ſelf. This is a way many a vertuous Woman takes to injure her good Reputation; for ſhe that will deſpiſe and cenſure others, muſt expect, and will find, that others will deſpiſe and cenſure her.</p>
               <p>There are another ſort of Wives, tho' inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vertuous, yet outwardly ſo overflow with Pride, Vanity and Ambition, as they are ſo very mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to deſpiſe all below them, and hate all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons above them; which is a wicked Humour as to others, and an uneaſy one as to themſelves. Theſe Women, becauſe ſome of their Neighbours Beauty is perhaps greater, or their Quality high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or their Eſtate larger, or their Equipage richer, or their Wit quicker, or their Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping nobler, and the like; theſe, becauſe they cannot reach to their high rate of Life, condemn and cenſure their way of living as very bad, vain and extravagant; and becauſe they cannot live as ſplendidly as they do, give out, they do not livers prudent as they ought to do: And becauſe theſe envious Women are themſelves too proud,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38135:14"/>give out, that their Neighbours are ſo too; and by their unjuſtly and enviouſly cerſuring their Pride (meerly upon the account of their own) it often inflames, and cauſes, or rather forces, their great Neighbours to condemn their Folly in ſo doing, and perhaps their Chaſtity to boot; and ſo to occaſion many others to ſpeak ill of them by their Example: For Perſons of high Quality and great Reputation, their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, like Bullets ſhot out of great Guns, they carry farther, and pierce deeper than out of a leſſer ſize, tho' of a much better Mettle; the leſſer muſt ſubmit to the greater. Fertil Plains are not the worſe, tho' they are commonly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topt by barren Hills.</p>
               <p>This is a uſual way that many good Women make others cenſure their Vertue, meerly out of Revenge, (a Fountain many ill and ſcandalous Streams flow out of) and thus by their indiſcreet Carriage and malicious Reports, and cenſuring others good Name, they loſe their own, by cauſing others to condemn and cenſure them; by which vain practice they are ſtill like to come by the worſt, which made <hi>Solomon</hi> rank among worldly Vanities, <hi>That a Man ſhould not contend with one that is mightier than himſelf,</hi> Eccleſ. 6.10.</p>
               <p>There are another kind of vertuous Wives that occaſion their being ill talk'd of, and Sacrifice their Reputation, becauſe they will not follow the Manners and Faſhions of the Country they live in, and thoſe of Quality they are Neighbours to, being ſo vain, proud, and fooliſhly Self-conceited, that becauſe they cannot be allow'd a Pattern to all, ſcorn to follow the Examples of any, tho' of higher Degree, larger Fortunes,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38135:15"/>and much better Reputation and Eſteem than themſelves.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here name but one Example of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I could give you, in order to convince you, That all Perſons are oblig'd by the Rules and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of civil Society, Prudence, and well and eaſy liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to follow the Manners, Cuſtoms and Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Country they live in, and of the beſt and moſt eſteem'd Families they accompany with, and are Neighbours to; and this one Example I ſhall take out of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe it ſhall be ſtampt with the beſt, at leaſt moſt currant and modiſh Authority in the World. And, in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, 'Twas in my time, and I believe ſtill is, among Perſons of Quality, near as great a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal for a Lady to ſuffer a Man to ſit on her Bed, as to admit him to lie in it. As for inſtance: I remember when King <hi>Charles</hi> II. liv'd with Queen Mother in <hi>Paris,</hi> a French Gentleman, of good Quality and great Eſtate, fell deſperately in love with an Engliſh Lady, ſo as to deſire to Marry her (which I count Deſperate Love) and the Queen Mother had in a manner made up the Match; but, by an unfortunate accident (I mean only for the Lady) a near Kinſman and Friend of hers and Counſellor in all her concerns (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe of her private Amours) came purpoſely out of <hi>England</hi> to aſſiſt her in ſetling her Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and other Marriage concerns; and this Kinſman of hers, ignorant of the nice Punctilio's of the French Ceremonies, did (that he might the more eaſily hear her, and ſhe him, he not knowing, nor ſhe not remembring, how ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous 'twas for a Man to) ſit on a Lady's Bed, (which is no very ſtrange thing in <hi>England,</hi> where
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38135:15"/>it may be done without the leaſt harm, tho' it cannot in <hi>France,</hi> without the greateſt ſcandal) but unfortunately this Lady's Lover came in to viſit her, at the very nick of time that he was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on her Bed, and the Monſieur ſeeing a Man ſitting on her Bed, was ſo ſurpris'd at the Sight, and ſcandaliz'd at the Action, that tho' the Man's great Age had been of it ſelf a ſufficient Antidote againſt his Jealouſy, eſpecially know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how near of Kin he was to her, and how few days he declar'd ſtaying with her, yet, the Monſieur, without uſing any Words, or taking any Conſideration, immediately left her and her Chamber, and could never be perſuaded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to her again. This is only to mind you, That the Cuſtom of a Kingdom makes Rules and gives Laws in it's own Dominions, which no Woman ought to break, if ſhe deſires to keep her Reputation whole. And that Woman that knows ſhe ſhall loſe her Reputation, if ſhe will admit a Man to ſit on her Bed, in my Opinion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to loſe her good name for doing it; let the Action in it ſelf, and her intention as to her ſelf, be never ſo innocent.</p>
               <p>But this ſevere Cuſtom in <hi>France</hi> is nothing in compariſon to the Severities, or rather Cruelties that are generally practiſed in <hi>Italy,</hi> by Husbands towards their Wives; for, there, all young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen are kept and bred up in a ſtrict Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, in Nunneries, till married; and, when they are ſo, are kept but a kind of Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their own Houſes: So that all the Writ of Eaſe a Maid gets by marrying, is, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing one Priſon for another, which renders them the more eager after liberty; as penn'd up
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38135:16"/>Rivers ſwell for being confin'd, and run more violent when they get their freedom, for having been debarr'd of it, and hinder'd from their natural Courſe; ſo moſt of theſe impriſon'd Wives are kept chaſt by their Husbands ſtrict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ment of them, and careful watchfulneſs over them, rather than by the Motions of their own natural Temper, or vertuous Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>But for my own part as I utterly deteſt the Severities Husbands uſe to their Wives in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo I do not altogether approve the great Freedoms that many Husbands do allow their Wives in <hi>England,</hi> (or their Wives will allow themſelves) ſome Husbands granting them ſuch large Ranges of Liberty, as they, by it, often ſhew more alonfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their Wives, than Diſcretion in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Since a large liberty, without a ſuitable proportion of prudence to well manage it, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cauſes high Extravagancies, and foul Exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and therefore, I believe, as many Husbands have made their Wives diſhoneſt by too much miſtruſting them (for Revenge is very ſweet and natural to Women) ſo I alſo believe ſome Wives have been made diſhoneſt by their Husbands too much truſting them: Opportunity often makes a Thief, which had not perhaps been a Thief, but for the opportunity. The <hi>Italians</hi> have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way of reaſoning, as to the ſecuring their Wives, by ſaying, That no Wife can be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt without an Opportunity to be ſo, (Time and Action being inſeparable) therefore, ſay they, ever keep your Wife from an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and you will ever keep her honeſt. But God forbid that all Men that have opportunity ſhould
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38135:16"/>be Thieves; or that all Women that allow Men Opportunity, ſhould allow them Enjoyment. For tho' the <hi>Italians</hi> ſay as true, That there can be no Enjoyment without Opportunity, ſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſay as true, That there may be Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, without Enjoyment. I Remember in <hi>Rome,</hi> upon a diſcourſe with an <hi>Italian,</hi> of the great freedoms Wives were allow'd in <hi>England;</hi> I heard him ſwear a great Oath, That he would not truſt the great God with his Wife, when ſhe was alone in Bed: And asked me, not only with a ſerious, but furious Countenance, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ſtrange Report could be true, That the Married Women in <hi>England</hi> had liberty to go abroad with Men, and to receive Viſits from them in their Chambers; nay, ſometimes when they were in Bed? I aſſur'd him, 'twas very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That the Women of the higheſt Quality, greateſt Eſteem and beſt Reputation, do both go abroad with Men in their Company, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Men's Viſits in their Cambers, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; by Men, (at the uſual viſiting hours,) when they were in Bed, and by near Kindred at all times, and that this Freedom was allow'd by vertuous and great Women, to Men, without the leaſt ſcandal; for neerneſs of Kin, tho' it cannot greatly foul Actions, yet it can protect Freedoms. But for a Married Woman to admit the liberty to a Man that's no way related to her ſelf, Husband or Family (except upon ſome good ground or extraordinary occaſion) argues, in my Opinion, great Weakneſs, and high Indiſcretion, being a thing, I cannot with prudence approve, nor a Wife, I think, with diſcretion admit; for tho' ſome may favour ſuch a Freedom with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38135:17"/>conſtruction, yet others may brand it with a ſcandalous Interpretation; and uſually indiſcreet Freedoms produce diſhonourable Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: And that married Man that allows young Gallants to viſit his Wife more than ordinary, muſt allow Men to ſpeak more than ordinary of her for it, or they will be ſure to allow it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Therefore, a ſtrict, vertuous Wife, ought ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to reflect on the Hazard ſhe runs, the Folly ſhe commits, and the Diſhonour ſhe may ſuffer in her Reputation, by allowing a Man that's unfitly qualified, ſo great a freedom. Now as an Antidote to prevent reacting the like Indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall adviſe that Wife that admits ſuch Freedom to a Man at unviſiting hours, ſeriouſly to conſider, and ſoberly to reaſon and argue with her ſelf, by ſuppoſing that this her now dear Friend, ſhe's ſo fond of, and ſo much relies in, ſhould chance to become her Enemy, and brag he has enjoy'd her; (for ſuch things have been certainly done formerly, and may poſſibly be done again) whether ſhe can, after ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and ſtrict examination, ſatisfy her ſelf, that ſhe's able in this caſe, to alledg more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and produce better Arguments to juſtify her Chaſtity, than her Enemy can bring to accuſe her Vertue, before unconcern'd and unbyaſs'd Judges.</p>
               <p>Let her, therefore, ſuppoſe the worſt of her late dear Friend, but now great Enemy, that he ſhould ſwear, That he came often into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber when ſhe was alone in it in Bed, and that ſhe order'd and aſſign'd him that opportunity and conveniency, that they might enjoy one another,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38135:17"/>as they then did; and, to confirm the Truth of this Accuſation, he ſays, ſhe that was certainly ſo indiſcreet as to allow the one, might poſſibly be ſo unvertuous as to admit the other; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges his being alone with her, to back the Truth of what he now Swears, and to publiſh the Folly of that ſhe then did; and farther adds, That he can prove this her Indiſcretion, by her own act. But ſhe can never prove her Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, when they were ſo alone by her own Words.</p>
               <p>Therefore, let her ſeriouſly reflect and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how weak and ſlight her Defence muſt be againſt her Enemies ſworn Accuſation, let her Wit be never ſo great, and her Innocency never ſo clear, ſince ſhe cannot produce ſo much as one ſingle Witneſs, to confirm the Truth of what ſhe ſays, or to contradict the Truth of what he Swears, having only her own bare Word, and that in her own Cauſe, and to defend her own Honour, and Reputation, which ſhe has expos'd to Cenſure, by the imprudent liberty ſhe allow'd her then Friend, either on the account of her too little Wit, or too much Love, or at leaſt too great want of Diſcretion and Conſideration.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe ſhe may make to his Accuſation, ſome kind of Defence of this nature, That in the firſt place, for his accuſing her of ſuffering him to viſit her at unuſual viſiting hours, when ſhe was alone in her Chamber in Bed, that part ſhe does not deny, becauſe ſhe cannot well do it; ſays, 'twas never but once, and that once was meer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental. Secondly, At the time he ſo viſited her, he ſwore he was, and ſhe verily believed him to be an honeſt Man and her real Friend, as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38135:18"/>well as her long and intimate Acquaintance. Thirdly, She takes God, <hi>The Searcher of all Hearts,</hi> to be her Witneſs, that ſhe did not then, or ever before or after, act any thing with him in Thought, Word or Deed, that was not truly vertuous and purely innocent, which his Heart knows to be a real Truth, as well as he knows, what he ſwears to the contrary, to be an errant malicious Lie. And, Laſtly, ſhe ſays, That ſcandalous Reports againſt Women of Quality and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ought only to be credited by ſober and prudent Perſons, but according to what they ſee themſelves, and not according to what they hear from others; becauſe 'tis in the power of any wicked Man, to raiſe and caſt ſcandalous Reports on the moſt vertuous Woman in the World. All this I grant a Woman may alledge in her own Defence and Juſtification, which I cannot eſteem much, becauſe ſhe could not well ſay leſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as to his Accuſation of her ſuffering him to viſit her when ſhe was alone in Bed at unuſual viſiting hours; as to her Anſwer, that 'twas altogether undeſignedly, and accidentally, and that 'twas never but once, and that ſhe was fully reſolv'd it ſhould never be ſo a ſecond time.</p>
               <p>To this part of her Juſtification it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That granting the Judges ſhould take her own bare Word, (For ſhe can give no more, that what ſhe ſays is a real Truth) yet it may be objected, That a Woman that will allow her ſelf to do one act of Indiſcretion, in her carriage towards a Man, it may be indeed a reaſonable inducement to believe ſhe may be perſwaded to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38135:18"/>commit another. But to draw an Argument, that tho' ſhe committed one act of Indiſcretion, yet we are to credit her bare word, that ſhe will never be brought to commit a ſecond, is but a weak and an irrational Concluſion; for if a pure ſenſe of Honour and true Love of Reputation, regulates all a Woman's Actions, and Carriage towards all Men, (as certainly it ought) that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would never be ſo imprudent, as to allow one freedom to her favorite Friend, at any time, which ſhe could not honourably own, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly juſtify at all times, and in all Places and Companies, in caſe her Friend ſhould become her Enemy; but indeed moſt Women are too apt to miſtake the difference between the word Lover, and the thing Friend; for they will have them to be both one and the ſame thing, when in deed they are very oft'n far from being ſo; for tho' every true Friend muſt be a true Lover, yet every pretending Lover is not a true Friend, as many Ladies can Witneſs by woful Experience: But if <hi>Venus</hi> Love had then the predominant Power over her Inclinations, as it certainly has over many Women, towards the favourite Man of her preſent fancy, it may be better, and much more rationally argued, That the ſame amorous Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which at that time over-ruled her Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by admitting him one freedom more than ſhe ſhould, might as well at another time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power her Diſcretion by admitting him a ſecond liberty more than ſhe ought; for ſhe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits one act of indiſcretion, ſhews, by it, a probability that ſhe may be prevail'd with to act a ſecond; but no impoſſibility againſt her being perſwaded to commit a third.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:38135:19"/>
               <p>Next, as to that part of her juſtification, That the Man that did viſit her when ſhe was alone in her Chamber in Bed, at an unuſual viſiting hour, 'twas never but once, and that once was by one ſhe verily believed to be her true, faithful Friend, as well as her long and old Acquaintance: But to this it may well be anſwered, That 'tis very common for great Friends, to prove great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and often the greater Enemies, for having been great Friends; as the Weight of a Pendulum Clock, falls the more backward, for being ſhoved the more forward: And this I am ſure, that there can be no Friendſhip in the whole World, that is ſo looſely Tack'd on, as that between a Man and a Woman, on a meer Beauty Account, which muſt of courſe be deſtroy'd by Death, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd by Sickneſs, and may be broken in pieces by a Thouſand Accidents: Witneſs that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon one, of a Man growing to like another Woman better than his Miſtreſs, or ſhe to fancy another Man better than him, (a common Fate that attends moſt Beauty-Lovers), and ſo they grow to diſlike one another; for great Beauty, tho' it often creates great Fondneſs, yet it ſeldom contains a long conſtant Love: For as Beauty is pleaſing, ſo 'tis Clogging; and we know that the fineſt Sweet Meats, make the fouleſt Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits.</p>
               <p>For there we find it very uſual among our young Gallants, that tho' one of them has in a manner forſaken his Miſtreſs, yet that Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indure to ſee her Love another Man; and 'tis ten to one ſhe cannot indure to be without another Man to Love; and this creates Anger and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in her firſt Lover, and perhaps provokes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38135:19"/>him to caſt out Words that may highly reflect on her Honour; (ſo vile and ill-natur'd is our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age, as moſt Men are much readier to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge a meer fancied Injury, than to requite a real received Obligation.) And if a Wife that allows a Man the freedom of viſiting her, when ſhe is alone in Bed (at unuſual viſiting Hours) will but truly own the ſecret Thoughts of her Heart, I am confident ſhe cannot deny, but that one of the principal Motives that induced her to grant her Lover that imprudent Freedom, was much occaſion'd on this vain and fooliſh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, That ſhe hoped, by her allowing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Liberty to him, it would produce extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Returns of Kindneſs to her: Which is but a ſimple Fancy, ſince that Woman that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges her Favours and Freedoms to a Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the juſt Bounds and Limits of a prudent, modeſt, and a decent Carriage, tho' that Man may in Heat of Blood, ſeemingly embrace them with an eager Fondneſs, and a paſſionate Delight; yet if he be either a Lover of Vertue, or a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Reaſon, he cannot, but in his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſpiſe her for it, and conclude, by her granting ſuch over-large Liberties to him, it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors more of hot Love, than true Friendſhip; and he cannot but in reaſon judge, That as her preſent fond Love makes her now grant to him more Freedom than is decent, ſo ſhe may in a little time as well ſhew more Kindneſs to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than is diſcreet: For Beauty-love cannot be built upon any ſettl'd firm Foundation, but on a Hill of Sand, which looks high, but ſtands weak; nor is it rais'd and maintain'd by true Reaſon or pure Friendſhip, but rather hangs by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38135:20"/>Geometry; that is, depends on a meer flaſhy, airy, amorous Fancy, as little durable as Summers Rain, or Winters Sun; and therefore that Perſon ſhe fancies moſt, ſhe will be ſure to love beſt, and be fondeſt of, and kindeſt to, during the preſent amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fit. And for that Wife, taking God, <hi>the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all Hearts,</hi> to be her Witneſs, That ſhe never acted with that Man that accuſes her, any thing but what was truly Vertuous. Indeed ſhe does well to take the God of Heaven to be her Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for ſhe can have none on Earth, except the Man, that Witneſſeth againſt her: And, therefore, I ſhall deſire her ſeriouſly to conſider, how is it poſſible to judge of a Woman's inward Intentions, but by her outward Actions; and if they be indiſcreet, how can any juſtly ſay, her inward intentions are not ſo, ſince none can judge of the one, but by the other? For we are to believe according to what we ſee, and not according to what we hear, or the Woman vows ſhe means, which (unleſs to God, <hi>the Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all Hearts</hi>) can be only known to her ſelf, and conſequently ſhe can only be a credible Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to her ſelf, and not others, as to her own inward intentions.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for the excuſe ſhe alledges, That it lies in the Power of any wicked Man to raiſe and caſt ſcandals on the Reputation of the moſt Vertuous Woman on Earth, as that ſhe admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch a Man to viſit her, when ſhe was alone in her Chamber a Bed, when perhaps ſhe never ſaw him out of it, much leſs he her in it, having never poſſibly heard his Name, much leſs knew his Perſon; Theſe kinds of Reports, I grant lie in the power of every wicked Man, to raiſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38135:20"/>on any Vertuous Woman: But I deny 'tis in the Power of every wicked Man, to make a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Woman ſay, ſhe admitted him to viſit her alone in Bed, when ſhe never did; and to own an indiſcreet Act, which ſhe never committed. Indeed I have known many wicked Men diſown ill things that they have done; but I never heard of a diſcreet Woman own an ill thing ſhe never did; ſo that I think it needleſs to write any more than, That I look upon ſuch groundleſs ſcandals, ſo falſly rais'd, and ſhot at Random at a good Woman's Reputation, to be only able to ſhew a malicious Man's ill Nature, not juſtly to brand a Vertuous Woman's good Name. But I fear I have already not only writ too much, but too ſharp on this Nice Subject; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſhall only give this good, tho old Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to all vertuous Wives, which is, ſtill to uſe an Enemy, as if he may become a Friend; and a Friend (eſpecially in love matters) as if he may become an Enemy; that is, a prudent Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought not to ſhew too much Kindneſs to the one, nor declare too fierce a Hatred againſt the other; but to manage with Diſcretion and Moderation, her carriage to both, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Piety, Vertue and due Conſideration, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate all her Actions; and ſhe that obſerves theſe good Meaſures, will be ſure never to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any Perſon (eſpecially a Lover) any private freedom which ſhe cannot honourably own, and publickly juſtify.</p>
               <p>Farther, a Vertuous Woman ought ſtill to carry in her Mind, That ſhe is bound to ſatisfy all Perſons as to her Vertue, as well as her ſelf; others Tongues, as well as her own Heart. Nor
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38135:21"/>ought a vertuous Maid, or Wife, to depend much upon her Lover's Vows or Oaths of a true and conſtant Love, and a perfect unalterable Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; ſince moſt of their Vows and Love Oaths, being built upon fading Beauty, which is but a Sandy Foundation, their Friendſhip commonly moulders away, with the Beauty that created it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall, therefore, adviſe all handſom vertuous Women not to depend much on their Lovers fair Words, but on their own good Actions, ſtrict pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Carriage, and pure Vertuous Life; and ſhe that obſerves theſe good Meaſures, will be ſure not to ſhew too much Love or Hatred to any Man, nor ever expoſe her Reputation to her Lover's Humor; ſince by ſo doing, ſhe's no longer his Queen and Miſtreſs, but his Subject and Servant, by truſting her Humour into his Power, and what is worſe, to his Mercy: And <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wiſeſt of Men, gives Men this good adviſe, <hi>Advoid Suretyſhip, and you ſhall be ſure:</hi> And the like Caution and Prudence alſo leads Women, not to be bound for, nor to truſt in any Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Lover's Oaths, for this good reaſon, That if you never truſt him, he can never deceive you; but if you do, he may: And as 'tis natural for all Women to hope the beſt, ſo 'tis diſcreet in all Women to fear the worſt, and to arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt others bad Tongues as well as againſt their own ill Acts. And as Diſcretion muſt ever be a great Vertue among Women ſo Indiſcretion muſt ever be a great Vice; for all it's being a great Mode, I eſteem In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion to be much alike to Wickedneſs, as Covetouſneſs is to Evil, which is not only an evil Root, but the Root of all Evil.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38135:21"/>So Indiſcretion is not that ſole Iſſue of one Vice, but the fruitful Parent of many, if not moſt. Now remember this, That tho' 'tis poſſible that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may be vertuous, and not diſcreet in ſome Caſes; yet 'tis impoſſible in any Caſe, that a Woman can be indiſcreet by being Vertuous, ſince Diſcretion is a part of Vertue.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here give it as a general Rule, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Exception, That a Vertuous Woman muſt ſtill make a fond Wife; for Vertue is ſtill the Gift of God, but a Husband is often the gift of a Father, and ſometimes forced by him, and not choſen by her: And I will appeal to all Men and Women-kind, if this be not a great and real Truth, That a Wife's liking and loving a Husband, muſt depend ſolely upon her own free Choice, and not upon her Father's Will: She may, indeed, obey what pleaſes him, but ſhe cannot love but what pleaſeth her ſelf: Love is to be led, not drawn: Vertue may make her a good Wife, but Love can only make her a fond one, and Content a happy one.</p>
               <p>Now tho' 'tis certain, That natural Heat ſtill works ſtrong in all young Women's Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; yet 'tis far from being certain, That Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's Love to their Husbands, does ſtill work ſtrong in all young Wives Minds; for tho' a brisk Heat ſtill waits on a Woman's Conſtitution, whilſt ſhe is a young Woman, yet a brisk Love to a Husband does not ſtill attend a Woman's Inclinations, whilſt ſhe's a young Wife: And the reaſon of this is plain, becauſe often a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Love and liking in the choice of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, only ſprings from, and is but the bare Iſſue of her then firſt Fancy; which, perhaps,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38135:22"/>had not the leaſt mixture of good Reaſon, or true Conſideration in its compoſure, but was meerly to gratify her paſſionate, amorous Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; and ſuch a kind of Love, or rather Frenzy, is uſually but like a Fire of Straw, which tho' it lights quick, and burns fierce, yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes ſoon; and this cauſes her Love-flame, to laſt no longer than her Love-fancy, which is uſually but of a ſhort duration, as well of a fickle compoſition: But the natural Temper of a young healthful Womans Conſtitution, its Operation may be of long Continuance, and muſt laſt as long as her youthful Health does: Whereas the fickle Love to the Husband of her meer Fancy, may poſſibly not laſt ſo long as her Youth, or Health either.</p>
               <p>This is the Cauſe that many of the hot, fiery <hi>Venus</hi>-Brood of young Wives, love their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands more for the Mans ſake, than the Man for the Husbands ſake; for the Man's part oft'n cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates Pleaſure, but the Husbands part oft'n oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions Trouble, which makes many of the young Mettle ſort of Wives, to like well enough cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling with their Husbands by Night, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, with <hi>Guſto,</hi> reliſh their ſingle Company by day; for they can then entertain themſelves with ſweet Variety; which plainly demonſtrates what kind of Divertiſement ſuch ſort of Wives Love to their Husbands aims at, and is delighted in.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here venture to lanch my Diſcourſe into the vaſt Ocean of Reaſons and Pretences that there happens in Husbands loving or hating their Wives; nor ſhall I here pretend in the leaſt, to mark out the juſt bounds and true Meaſures that Husbands ought to uſe in the Truſting or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38135:22"/>Miſtruſting their Wives Carriage in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Chaſtity; only thus much I may ſafely write, That there muſt be great Care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in raiſing or falling this Spring, that muſt turn this Engine; for over-Liberty, or over-Watchfulneſs and Reſtraint of Husbands to Wives, are of ſuch dangerous Conſequences, that a Failure of the exact Proportions, and juſt Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of either ſide, may prove of fatal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Therefore I ſhall only ſay, That a wiſe Husband ought to obſerve a moderate Care between both theſe Extremities, which is the moſt diſcreet and ſecure way; and doubtleſs a politick Husband ought ſo warily and prudently to ſteer his Courſe, and ſoberly and carefully to manage his Carriage towards his Wife, as to avoid ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too great a Jealouſie of her, or granting too great a Liberty to her, leſt the firſt may make her what ſhe ſhould not be; and the ſecond cauſe her to make him what he would not be.</p>
               <p>But 'tis more than time to beg your Pardon for having led your Thoughts as far as <hi>Italy,</hi> the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the World, only to ſhew and entertain you with the worſt Weed in it, which is the Husbands of that Countrey's jealous and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Uſage of their Wives. I ſhall now conclude this Branch of my Diſcourſe by only adding, That many Vertuous Wives cauſe many ill Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes, and ſharp reflecting Cenſures on their Reputation and good Name, by their being ſo vain, proud and fooliſhly indiſcreet, as not to follow the Faſhions of their Betters; for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there are Rules and Meaſures in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Dreſſes, as well as other Things, which Women, by the Rules of Diſcretion and Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38135:23"/>and the Orders of Civil Society, ought to obſerve and follow, according to the general Practice, that ſuch of their own Quality wear, and the Country they live in, uſe; and the beſt and moſt vertuous Perſons they are Neighbours to, thoſe to be Followers of, and to make a ſtrict Friendſhip with; for men commonly judge of Womens Inclinations, by the Company they make choice of, and are delighted in.</p>
               <p>There are another ſort of Vertuous Wives, which is the laſt Sort I ſhall ſpeak of, who, for all their great Vertue, will yet make a hard ſhift but they will be ill talk'd of: Theſe are a nice, delicate, ſqueamiſh ſort of Virtuous Wives, who are, (or at leaſt would have all think they be) great Criticks, and ſtrict Followers of all the Punctilio's that belong to, and are uſeful for the maintaining a pure and clear Reputation in this World, ſo as to deſerve and preſerve a high and vertuous Eſteem of all Perſons, fancying they juſtly merit all Mens Praiſes, and no ones Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; having ſuch nice and curious Palates, in point of good Reputation, as they cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Scandal of allowing a Gallant; but yet can, at the ſame time, ſuffer the publick Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Entertaining a He-Friend, as a dear, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and conſtant Companion; and hope the good Name of Friend, will ſmother the bad one of Gallant. Indeed the Name of Friend, may ſerve as a Blind againſt a Wives own Fears, but it cannot ſtill prove a Defence againſt others Tongues. So vile and cenſorious is our preſent Age, as moſt of our young Mens Diſcourſes of hanſom Women, are ſo very Satyrical, as they generally interpret young Men and Womens en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38135:23"/>one another, to be but Courtſhip, that ſavors more of pure <hi>Venus</hi>-Love, than true Platonick Friendſhip; and I can too truly ſay, before hanſom Women can make all young Mens Courtſhip to paſs for true Friendſhip, they muſt weed out of this Country all the buſie, ſharp, ill-natur'd Cenſures in it, who ſnatch up any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to worry and devour a Womans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; for they will tell you, That the pure ſtate of Innocency was never but in one Woman, which was the firſt of her Sex, and will be the laſt of that Kind: And as it begun ſoon, ſo it laſted not long; for it left her, before ſhe left the World. Now it may be argued, That if the Nature of the Mother of all Women-kind, when ſhe was in perfect Soundneſs and Strength, would then yield to an Enemy in Paradiſe, what may be now expected from her Daughters in this wicked World, and vicious Age? If a Woman could ſtumble then in a pure Light, why ſhould any wonder that many Women ſhould fall now in this our Age of Sin and Darkneſs? And if a Woman could not defend her ſelf againſt one Tempter then, why may not many Women yield to divers Tempters now, that there are near as many young Men that are Seducers, as there are young Women that are hanſom? Eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering in what a ſuperlative Degree, Vice, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Idleneſs poſſeſſes moſt of them; and that our vain Ladies Love to their Gallants, is now as very much in Uſe, as great Beauty is in Eſteem, and ſtrict Piety out of practice.</p>
               <p>And if when there was but one Man, and one Woman in all the World, ſo that ſweet Variety could not be then in faſhion; yet all know, That
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38135:24"/>one Woman could not then be true to that one Man, but did deceive him, meerly for deceiving-ſake; for ſhe could not then leave one Man for another, which is now grown a common Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh Practice. Therefore it may be argued, That by the ſame Rule and Parity of Reaſon, That as the Woman did deceive the one Man, when ſhe was in Paradiſe, ſo may many Wives now deceive many Husbands, whilſt they are here out of it; for as there are plenty of <hi>Eve</hi>'s Daughters that ſtill retain the Subtilty of their Mother, ſo there will be ever plenty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sons that will ſtill retain the Folly of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and be beguiled by their Wives; which is a Weakneſs and Diſtemper that's now grown ſo common and infectious, as 'tis like the Plague that reign'd ſo univerſally in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the whole Land. And all our moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctors are ſo very weak and ignorant in the means of preſcribing a Remedy for this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to others, as they cannot ſo much as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an Antidote againſt it for themſelves, tho' they ſhou'd all joyn in a Conſultation.</p>
               <p>And as the World is now more increaſed in Men and Women, ſo 'tis alſo in Sins and Vices, Women having a thouſand Arts, Cheats and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements to decoy Men with, which were not known then, tho' commonly practiſed now. Therefore all Women, not only of the vain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Brood, but of the moſt vertuous and pious Kind, are in Duty oblig'd to make it their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Endeavours, and hearty Prayers to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, That he will pleaſe to repair the Defects of their Earthly Nature, by the Supplies of his Heavenly Grace, that the Strength of this latter
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38135:24"/>may conquer the Weakneſs of the former; and that as they are by Nature frail, and inclin'd to do what's ill, ſo they may, through Gods Mercy, love to practiſe what's Good, and to ſhake off the wanton and vicious Inclinations of the Fleſh, to put on the heavenly Motions of the Holy Spirit, which will certainly make a Woman love God, and keep his Commandments; which will give her a happy Content of Mind whilſt ſhe lives, and a bleſſed Peace of Conſcience when ſhe comes to die And I am ſure neither a vain Life, nor a Fop of a Gallant, can ever bring either.</p>
               <p>It may be farther ask'd, Where is the great Difference between a meer Beauty-Lover and a meer Gallant's Friendſhip, when 'tis only the Womans Beauty that creates and maintains the Gallant's Love, and his falſe ſubtil Craft that nick-names his meer <hi>Venus</hi>-Love, by miſcalling it real Friendſhip? And as many vertuous Wives deceive and flatter themſelves in the Title of their Lovers, by calling their Gallants their Friends; ſo many Women are cozen'd in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Meaſures of their Love: They'll tell you, and with reaſon too, (a thing not very common among Women) That 'tis immodeſt and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous for a Wife to admit a Man to make Love and publick Courtſhip to her: But they'll tell you at the ſame time, That a Wife is not bound to take notice a Man makes Love to her, till he tells her ſo; which, in my Opinion, is a very ſenſeleſs fancy, ſince that makes the fault of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Womans admitting a Mans making love to her, not to conſiſt in her receiving it from him, but in his telling it to her; not in her ſuffering him to do it, but in his acquainting her, that he do's it.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:38135:25"/>
               <p>Sure that Woman's Judgment muſt be very dull, and her Eye-ſight very dim, that can be ſo groſly miſtaken, as to fancy a Man's making love to her, is not to be taken notice of, by ſeeing it her ſelf, but by her hearing it from him; when 'tis moſt certain, that the Eye is a much quicker and ſurer Witneſs than the Ear; as may be obſerv'd in firing a Cannon, the Flame of the Powder comes to the Eye before the Noiſe of the Gun do's to the Ear; and that Woman muſt be ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dull, that cannot diſcern a man's amorous Looks, and paſſionate Actions, and Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, that he is in love (or at leaſt pretends it by acting as if he were) without his down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right telling her he is.</p>
               <p>A Woman may poſſibly hear, and yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what ſhe hears; but 'tis impoſſible ſhe can plainly ſee, and not believe what ſhe plainly ſees; for ſeeing is believing; and if we ſhould deny Sight to be a ſufficient credible Witneſs, we muſt by it deny the Foundation of all Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; for the Apoſtles ſeeing our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Miracles that he did in his Life-time, and both ſeeing of him, and converſing with him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was riſen from the dead, is the great Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we have that he is ſo.</p>
               <p>I grant 'tis not in a Wive's Power to hinder a Man from liking, loving, and eſteeming her; but ſure 'tis in any Wive's Power to avoid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, or at leaſt countenancing a Man's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Viſits, and entertaining his publick Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And really it cannot poſſibly enter into my Belief, how a Woman that's certainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd that ſuch a Man loves her paſſionately well on the account of her Beauty, and who confirms
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38135:25"/>it in all his Words and Actions, and by his high Concerns for her, and abundant Courtſhip to her, which ſhe receives with great Kindneſs, Freedom, and Satisfaction, ſeeming to be abundanly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd of his great and paſſionate Love, and that ſhe cannot but be aſſur'd that he knows ſhe knows ſo much; and yet that I muſt believe at the very ſame time, that ſhe can be ſo very fierce, and barbarouſly ill-natur'd, as if that Man ſhe knows ſo highly loves her, ſhould yet dare to tell her, he do's ſo, ſhe ſhould from that moment ſhun him, and forſake him: This, I confeſs, ſeems to me ſuch a Paradox in Love, and is ſo extravagant, ſo extraordinary, and ſo highly impracticable, as 'tis much fitter for all Mens Wonder, than any ſober Man's Belief.</p>
               <p>Therefore let ſuch wild Romantick humour'd Ladies ſay what they will, I am ſure all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Women are to conſider, as they ought, which is, That few young Men make Love to a Woman (I mean upon meer Beauty-account) but on this ſcore, that either he fancies ſhe likes him, and ſo is inclin'd to be civil, if not kind to him, or he has ſome hope, that in time ſhe will be both; or elſe he muſt be a great Fool, eagerly to ſtrive for that he never expects to obtain, and fiercely to beſiege that Place he never hopes to take; and ſo might as wiſely build in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Air, or employ his time in weighing of Flames, or making his ſtudy to anſwer <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Queſtion, <hi>What Profit hath he that laboureth for the Wind?</hi> I am ſure, if he thinks there may be ſome, <hi>Solomon</hi> thought there was none.</p>
               <p>Really, I have often entertain'd my ſelf with the Thoughts of what a ſtrange Brood of Lovers
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38135:26"/>our next Age will produce, conſidering the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our preſent one, in which many (I think I might have ſaid moſt) handſom Womens Pride, Vanity, Idleneſs and Inconſtancy reign in them ſo powerfully, and is practiſed by them ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, as nothing is more common, except the Debauchery of their Gallants; and how Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and Religious a Brood, Vice, Idleneſs and Vanity will produce, the next Age will be able to tell you more, if poſſible, than this: I'm ſure in this 'tis become common (I had almoſt ſaid natural) for moſt of our handſom Women to be more inclin'd to Vice than Vertue; and for our young Men to be readier to ſpeak ill than well of them, and to be more apt to credit all malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reports, than to ſearch into any real Truths; to believe what Men ſay, than to examine what Women do, and what Character they juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. And if in their Love-Rambles, and Beauty-Chace they meet with a handſom Woman that's truly vertuous (which is a kind of Rarity) they uſually avoid her, becauſe ſhe is ſo; and if they light on a handſom Woman that is unvirtuous (which is far from being a Rarity) they deſpiſe her for being ſuch; many of our young Gallants being grown ſuch ſubtile Logicians in the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of making love, as to form to themſelves this manner of arguing, That a handſom Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that can be perſwaded to become too kind to one Man, may by the ſame Rule of Folly and Wickedneſs, be perſwaded to grow too common to many. And as a virtuous Woman ſtill carries in her mind the agreeable Satisfaction of doing what ſhe ought to do; ſo an unvirtuous Woman often carries in her Body the ſad Effects for doing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38135:26"/>what ſhe ought not to have done; which great ill in ſome Women, often occaſions ſome good in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men, by terrifying them from acting that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sin, for fear of meeting that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>French</hi> Puniſhment that uſually attends it; for many of our fine young Gallants, tho' they do not fear the Sin of the Act, yet they dread the Sting of the Diſeaſe; the Pain of the Body here, tho' not the Torment of the Soul hereafter.</p>
               <p>To conclude in a word, The preſent modiſh ſuperficial Love of moſt of the fine young Gallants to their Miſtreſſes, is become like our preſent Coin, which either is ſo falſe, or ſo clipt, as there remains little of its outward Size, or inward Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. So moſt of our young Gallants pretended Love to their preſent Miſtreſſes is ſo falſified and debaſed by their brutiſh Luſt, and unvirtuous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, as they only cry up Women for their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not Goodneſs; moſt of them praiſing the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but in hopes to enjoy the former; moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing their Miſtreſſes Bodies more than their Souls or indeed their own either. Therefore a young, Gallants ſwearing to his Miſtreſs that he loves her as well as his own Soul, tho' it be a Compliment that ſounds great, yet in effect 'tis an Expreſſion that means little, becauſe he loves his own Soul ſo.</p>

                  <hi>THE SECOND DISCOURSE,</hi> Of meer Beauty-Love, and of ſome of the vile Arts, and wicked Deceits many of our Young Gallants uſe to ruine their Miſtreſſes Reputation, under a falſe Pretence of true Friendſhip; and of the great Folly of ſuch Ladies who delight in Cenſuring others, but ſlight all others Cenſuring them, becauſe they fancy they do not deſerve it, with ſome uſeful Advices thereon.</head>
               <p>I Shall begin this Diſcourſe with my Deſire to to the Reader, that he will pleaſe to believe this great Truth, That 'tis far from my Opinion to think there can hardly be a pure, virtuous and innocent Friendſhip between a beautiful young Woman, and a handſom young Man, except grounded upon a Marriage-account, or a near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation-ſcore; for tho' I confeſs I eſteem any other, ſome a-kin to a Rarity, yet I am far from belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it an Impoſſibility; tho' I look on meer Beauty-Friendſhip to be very fickle and undurable in moſt, becauſe it ſeldom laſteth longer than the Womans Beauty that createth it. But where a Friendſhip is juſtly grounded, well ſuited, and vertuouſly fixed, between a Man and a Woman, ſuch a Friendſhip is certainly one of the greateſt, and moſt laſting Satisfactions of this Life, ſince it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38135:27"/>may, and in ſome do's laſt as long as life it ſelf, and is the high Advantage a rational Man hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Beaſt, who, tho' he can love a Companion to eat with, yet he cannot chuſe a Companion-Friend to converſe with, to rely in, and make uſe of. And I am ſure none allows, nay, loves and eſteems more a well-qualified Friendſhip than I do; I mean ſuch a ſort of Friendſhip between a young Man and Woman, as is contracted and maintain'd upon a lawful and honourable Account, being founded on vertuous Addreſſes, as thoſe of true Friendſhip, Kindred-kindneſs. Marriage-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, or for Obligations done to ones Family in general; and Obligations of that nature, every one of that Family is to acknowledge as done to himſelf in particular, and accordingly endeavour a Requital, or upon any other handſom or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Account; for doubtleſs a Friendſhip that's vertuouſly qualified, and piouſly grounded, is altogether lawful and unſcandalous, as well as highly ſatisfactory; but my Deſign is here only to write againſt the common modiſh, and meer ſuperficial Beauty-Friendſhip that our young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants uſually have, or pretend to have for their Miſtreſſes, ſpringing out of a meer amorous fit, without any good Reaſon, or true Conſideration; growing up, Muſhroom-like, on a ſudden, and rais'd only by a ſight of a handſom Face at a Play, Park, Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſort of Love (or rather Fancy) for a Woman, I eſteem to be only great, becauſe her Beauty is ſo, he only lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her well, becauſe ſhe looks ſo. And ſure none can deny, but meer Face-Beauty is ſhallow, frail, inconſtant and undurable, being as very
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38135:28"/>fading as the Complexion 'tis much compos'd of, and chiefly illuſtrated with.</p>
               <p>I wiſh this ſort of Lovers would take into their ſerious Conſideration, where's the real Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction a Gallant can any way propoſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to take, in gazing on his Miſtreſſes Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Face, ſince at beſt, it can be but a momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Eye-pleaſure, a thing next to nothing, and as little laſting as 'tis little worth; ſo ſlight and ſandy a Foundation is meer Beauty built on, it being indeed only a fine bright burniſh'd Clay, inamell'd with pure white and red, which by many of our fine Ladies now a-days, is oftner bought with Money, than given them by Nature; and do but unmask the Skin of one of their Faces, whether her Beauty's bought or given, and 'twill certainly at firſt ſight prove loathſom to ones Eyes, and in a very little time noiſom to the Smell, being only fit for naſty Worms, not fine Gallants.</p>
               <p>Next let us ſuppoſe that an amourous young Gallant ſhould be ſo proſperous and fancically happy, as by the Expence of much time, many Oaths, and the Trial of a Thouſand coſtly Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fays, to gain not only her free leave to behold her beautiful Face, but to enjoy her beautiful Perſon. In the firſt place 'tis moſt certain, That a Beauty-chaſe after a handſom Face, is but like a Fox hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Recreation, which tho' you follow never ſo eagerly, yet the pleaſure lies only in the purſuit, not in the taking of the Game. Next, I ſhall deſire the young Gallant to ballance with the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures he enjoys, the many Troubles he muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by the ſeveral Fears, Doubts, Jealouſies and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38135:28"/>vexatious Diſappointments he muſt rencounter in the keeping and ſecuring his new Conqueſt; and ſure there needs no ſtronger an Argument to prove both the uncertainty and difficulty of keeping his Miſtreſs conſtant to himſelf, than the eaſineſs he found in perſwading her to prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant to another; for on the ſame ſcore that ſhe left another for him, ſhe may leave him for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Next I ſhall deſire this Beauty-Lover but to look into common Experience, and 'twill tell him, That as he will certainly be ſoon cloy'd with her Face, ſo he will be ſoon weary of her Body, ſince he loves the laſt, but for the firſt; and ſure no Man can be ſo ignorant in our wife, amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Romantick Age, as not to know that ſweet Variety is now all in faſhion, and that Love, like Beauty, cannot always laſt, becauſe great Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelf never did, nor never can: And tho' moſt of our fine, modiſh Ladies are, as to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry of having a Gallant very conſtant, yet as to the perſon of one Gallant, moſt of them are very inconſtant and changeable, becauſe one ſuits not with ſweet Variety, which is now become the common Mode, great Delight, and uſual Practice of moſt young Gallants and their Miſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>Now laſt of all, and indeed what's worſe, and moſt ſtrange of all, let us ſuppoſe that our young Gallant's Miſtreſs ſhould chance to prove ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous (which indeed is a chance) and is fully and unalterably reſolv'd to continue ſtill ſo; then muſt our hot, fierce, fiery Lover's eager deſire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the enjoying her, render his enflamed Heart, to be here on earth, as <hi>Dives</hi> his Soul was in Hell, tormented with a Thirſt never to be quenched; that is, whilſt her Beauty lives, or till his Love
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38135:29"/>dies; and indeed, the beſt of it is, both are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and neither long-liv'd. In a word, If we ſeriouſly ſearch into the true Nature, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Effects that meer Beauty-Love uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, we ſhall find 'tis ordinarily accompanied with great Fears, conſtant Jealouſies, and daily vexatious Diſappointments, which this ſort of Beauty-Love is uſually attended on, tormented with, and commonly expires in.</p>
               <p>And truly, Reader, 'tis only this ſort of noiſom <hi>Venus</hi>-Love, and meer Beauty Friendſhip that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt, having, as I ſaid before, no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Marriage-deſign, Family-Obligation, well-grounded Friendſhip, or ſo much of Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-pretence, as that of a <hi>Welſh</hi> Couſin, to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and countenance their long Viſits, and great Familiarity: But many Women fancy that the vertuous Name of Friendſhip excuſe the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous one of Gallant, never reflecting on the vaſt difference there is in the Carriage between a true pure Platonick Lover, and a meer Beauty-Gallant's Friendſhip towards the Woman they pretend a real kindneſs to, and a concern for, ſince he that's a Woman's true Friend indeed, muſt make it his main Buſineſs and great Care ſo to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all his Looks, Words and Actions that any way relate to that Woman he pretends and vows a true and vertuous Friendſhip for, as to avoid giving all Perſons the leaſt Occaſion or Umbrage to ſuſpect he has any Deſign to be eſteem'd her Beauty-admirer, or pretended Gallant, which is a Title, a real Friend, on the account of his true Friendſhip, ought as much to avoid, as a truly vertuous VVoman, on ſcore of her good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, ought truly to deteſt, ſince 'tis an
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38135:29"/>undeniable truth, That no Man can heartily loves a Womans Perſon, that does not truly love, and heartily endeavour to preſerve her good Name, and make her Honour part of his own. Nay, I am farther of opinion, that no Man does love a Woman as a real perfect Friend, that does not love her Reputation as much as if ſhe were his real Wife, that is, to be a true Partner, and joint-ſharer, in her good and bad Fame: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, a meer amorous Gallant, is a Friend to a Woman meerly becauſe ſhe's hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and only loves her, becauſe her Beauty likes him, and ſo is a concern'd party, only as to her good or bad look's, not her bad and good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; therefore he uſes all his Arts, and employs all his skill and endeavours, to accompliſh his wicked ends on her, he ſo eagerly Courts; and if her Piety and Virtue is ſo great as ſhe will not ſuffer him to enjoy her, yet his wicked deſign is ſo vile, as to ſtrive to make all Men believe he does it.</p>
               <p>In a word, this is the great difference between a true Friend, and a Fop Gallant, the firſt makes it his real deſign and hearty concern, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her Reputation; whereas the Amorous Gallant, makes it his grand buſineſs and ſole aim to deſtroy it: But moſt Ladies are ſo vain (I had almoſt ſaid fooliſh) as to fancy they can defend themſelves againſt all ſcandalous reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on their Reputation by the great Strength of their Wit; but really the ſtrength of ſuch vain Wit, ſprings often but from the Weakneſs of their Judgment; therefore I ſhall Caution that Woman who depend ſo much on the greatneſs of her own Wit, to beware of two things;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38135:30"/>the firſt, is, Not to rely too much on her own Wit: The ſecond, not to depend too much on her Gallants Oaths; leſt both fail her: For indeed 'tis very common for young Women to have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion of their own Wit than they ought, and to place a greater confidence in their Lovers Oaths than they ſhould, and ſo run into a double Error, by truſting their own Wit too much, and by miſtruſting their Gallants Oaths too little.</p>
               <p>Truly I have often obſerv'd, that many a young modeſt and baſhful Woman when her Lover makes the firſt approaches, as to the beſieging and gaining of her Heart, behaves her ſelf as many young Soldiers do at their firſt coming to the Siege of a Town; they are then fearful and cautious of all Shots made towards them, leſt they ſhould wound or kill them; but after the Siege hath continued ſome time, and they are accuſtomed to hear the Bullets fly about their Ears, and to ſee Men fall dead at their Feet, tho' their danger is full as great at laſt, as at firſt coming, yet the Cuſtom leſſens their Fears, tho' not their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and thoſe Shots, which at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Siege, they ſhun'd out of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, they afterwards ſlight through long Cuſtom. Indeed 'tis much alike with many a modeſt and baſhful young Maid, when her Lover makes his firſt approaches to the beſieging and gaining her Heart; at the beginning of the Siege, ſhe's very wary and fearful, bluſhing at every Praiſe her Lover ſhutes at her, or Compliment he makes to her, leſt he ſhould wound or deſtroy her good Reputation; but after ſhe has allowed her Gallants Siege for ſome time, and ſhes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38135:30"/>to hear his frequent Compliments, and Vollies of Oaths in her Praiſes, to fly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly about her Ears, as they grow more uſual to her, ſo ſhe grows leſs fearful of them, tho' they are not the leſs dangerous for being the more common, and the more they are truſted, the more they betray; for all know, a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on Friend, is worſe than a declar'd Enemy; for the firſt you lie open to, the other you arm your ſelf againſt. When I ſee a young Gallant highly praiſing, and eagerly courting his Miſtreſs (I ſtill except Marriage) and that ſhe ſeems much delighted in hearing his extravagant Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick Praiſes of her great Beauty and high Perfections, it puts me in mind of a ſtory in <hi>Aeſop's</hi> Fables, of a <hi>Fox</hi> that ſaw a <hi>Raven</hi> upon a Tree, with a Bit in his Mouth, which the <hi>Fox</hi> had a longing deſire to get, which put him a thinking and caſting about what way he might, Cheat the <hi>Raven</hi> of it; at laſt he concluded, there was no better nor more likely way, than to praiſe him out of it; and therefore he told the <hi>Raven,</hi> he was a moſt excellent Bird, and fell upon extolling and praiſing the gracefulneſs of his Perſon, the beauty of his Feathers, his admirable gift in Augury; and now, ſays the <hi>Fox,</hi> if you had but a Voice anſwerable to all your other excellent Qualities, the whole World could not ſhew ſuch another famous Creature: Theſe high Praiſes, and Nauſeous Flatteries, ſo tranſported the <hi>Raven,</hi> as it preſently ſet him upon opening his Mouth to try to Sing, and in that Eſſay he dropt the <hi>Foxe's</hi> deſired Bit, which he preſently run away with, and bid the <hi>Raven</hi> to remember, tho' he extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38135:31"/>his Beauty, yet he commended not his Brains.</p>
               <p>Indeed 'tis much alike, that of a young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants courting his Miſtreſs, and his over-magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and extolling her Beauty; uſually all the deſign his great Courtſhip aims at, is only for the deſired Bit of Enjoyment; which he no ſooner obtains, but he preſently quits his Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for her, and Courtſhip to her, and runs away in the purſuit of ſome new freſh Conqueſt; and in effect, ſays the ſame to the Woman, as the <hi>Fox</hi> did to the <hi>Raven;</hi> tho' he did commend her Beauty, he did not praiſe her Wit, but now Laughs at her Folly to be ſo deceived.</p>
               <p>The Moral of this Story is, That a Woman that can be ſo vainly fooliſh as to be brought to believe ſhe is, what indeed ſhe is not, may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, by the ſame Rule of Folly, be perſwaded to do what ſhe ought not to do; and to admit her Gallant to Stuff her Mind ſo full of the Praiſes of her Beauty, as ſhe has no room left, or time to ſpare, to think of Countermining her Gallants Plots againſt her Virtue and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for as many Lights blind the ſight, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Praiſes dim the Eyes of many Womens Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Conſideration; and whilſt her Gallant Swears ſhe's the Poſſeſſor of numbers of Virtues and Perfections, ſhe ought never to claim; ſhe neglects her Chaſtity, which ſhe ought ever to keep, leaving the ſubſtance of pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue for the ſhadow of vain Praiſes.</p>
               <p>Now I have done the Story of the Craft of the Four-legged <hi>Fox,</hi> I ſhall begin to name the Folly of many fine handſom Ladies, that ſuffer themſelves to be cheated by the vile Arts of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Two legged <hi>Foxes,</hi> which the Men
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38135:31"/>call <hi>Gallants;</hi> but moſt of the Ladies that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them, eſteeming the name of Gallant too courſe and ſcandalous, call them (or rather mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call them) their Friends: I wiſh I could ſay they were, by the Ladies, more known than truſted; but indeed they are truſted, becauſe not known.</p>
               <p>This ſort of Two-legged <hi>Foxes,</hi> are full as Crafty, altogether as Treacherous, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more Mischievous than the Four legged <hi>Foxes;</hi> becauſe theſe only worry the Bodies of poor ſmall inconſiderable Creatures, meerly to ſatisfy their Hunger; but theſe Two legged <hi>Foxes,</hi> called <hi>Gallants,</hi> often rot their Miſtreſſes Bodies, and ſometimes damn their Souls for ever, only to ſatisfy their preſent Luſt.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now a little glanſe my Diſcourſe on theſe Gallants uſual way of advancing their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches towards the gaining, their Miſtreſſes favour and eſteem, that is, the liberty to ruin their Reputation; for tho' moſt of our young Gallants are grown too crafty and well-bred, to tell them in plain down-right Engliſh, That their aim is to debauch and make them their Miſſes; yet moſt of their deſigns and endeavours are ſuch, whatſoever they ſay or ſwear to the contrary; and therefore they uſe many Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, and put on ſeveral Diſguiſes, that if one fail, another may take, garniſhing all their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes with great Oaths of a moſt paſſionate and moſt undecaying Friendſhip and Reality, and many ſuch like Lovers Canting Expreſſions, which uſually are as conſtant to one Womans Beauty, as the Wind is conſtant to one Point of the Compaſs; and indeed, both are ſo Waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inconſtant, as 'tis able to make a ſober
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38135:32"/>unconcerned perſon, to ſwell as much with Laughter, as the Ladies Gallant does with Love, to obſerve what Arts he uſes, what Stratagems he practiſes, what Pains he takes, what Oaths he makes, nay, what Oaths he breaks, to make his Miſtreſs believe him, what perhaps he is not, (for indeed few Gallants are) real, conſtant, and virtuous Lovers; for moſt of their Love-Oaths are not the true Iſſue of a pious, well-meaning, and unalterable Affection, but meerly the amorous and flaſhy effects of a luſtful vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſſion which they uſe to ſcrew themſelves up into their Miſtreſſes Favour; which the better to obtain, they cry her up for the beſt Woman and trueſt Friend in the whole World; That her beauty is charming, her Carriage Civil and obliging, her Converſe moſt agreeable, her Wit quick, her Motions taking, which make all that ſee her admire and praiſe her, and all that know her, love and eſteem her; in a word, ſhes Miſtreſs of all the Perfections of all Kinds, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and Qualities, that belong to the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the moſt perfect of her Sex; which makes her Gallant Swear, He is ſo far from being able ſingly to expreſs all her Merits, as 'tis not in the power of all the greateſt Wits in the World together to extract out of the 24 Letters ſo many Praiſes as her Merits juſtly claim and truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Now her Lover hath told her what ſhe now is; his next part is to Swear to her what he now is, and ever will be, in all his Pretences and Addreſſes to her, which is, that they ſhall be all ever pure, innocent and unbyas'd, free from all Self-intereſt and ill Deſigns, or ſo much as any unhandſom Thoughts, and ſo takes upon
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38135:32"/>him whether ſhe will or no, or at leaſt ſhe knows not why, the officious office of ſerving her in all her concerns, that is, in ſerving himſelf; for he deſigns they two ſhall be all one. This part I believe he means really; but for that of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Love, and unalterable Friendſhip, tho' he Swears to its Truth a thouſand times, yet as to that, I fancy he only deals with his Miſtreſs, as a Cheat does with a Merchant, that is Fool enough to truſt him; he promiſes him any thing, becauſe he reſolves to perform nothing; and defies the Ware he takes to be ſo bad, as the Payment he means to make. So theſe ſort of Beauty-admirers, love in effect but after this rate, Vowing to his preſent Miſtreſs, tho' he knows ſhe hath crowds of Adorers, yet none of them are to be compared to him; for he loves her not only above the World, but he love the World only for her; Swearing to her, That what ſhe diſlikes, he hates; what ſhe loves, he is fond of; and that her Will is his Will in all things; he being to her juſt like Clay in the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Hand, which ſhe may Work into what ſhape ſhe pleaſes: Theſe are his ordinary Proteſtations (I do not ſay real Meanings) and is the common Prelude to the Tune of his making love (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther practiſing deceit) ſince uſually all his large repeated Oaths only aim to make his Miſtreſs to him, as a Wife is to a Husband; which is, That they two ſhould be but one Fleſh, (Marriage ſtill excepted, for he will be to her Beauty, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Tenent at Will, not for Life;) and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hereunto, he ventures telling his Miſtreſs, That the Tye of Friendſhip is much more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and agreeable, than the dull heavy Chains
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38135:33"/>of Matrimony; for the firſt is made wholly and and ſoly by the Womans own voluntary choice, the other uſually by the advice and perſuaſion of Friends; nay, often by the terrible and powerful awe and threatnings of Parents; and ſure ſuch a Match as is made up by fear or force, and no Love nor liking, a Wife cannot but eſteem ſuch a Husband, to be rather a Trouble to her Days, than a Comfort to her Life.</p>
               <p>And now I name Marriage, give me leave by the by to tell you, in a word, my Opinion and Obſervation on Heireſſes of great Eſtates, That they are generally more unfortunately mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried than other Women that have but ſmall For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; becauſe rich Heireſſes, are commonly ſold by their Guardians, or betray'd by their Kinſmen or Favorite Waiting-Woman; for 'tis a fatal conſequence that uſually attends great Heireſſes, that becauſe they have greater Fortunes than they really need, they muſt have leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, than they truly want, and muſt enjoy lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Comfort, becauſe they poſſeſs much Riches. And as many Heireſſes are render'd unfortunate by having very large Fortunes, ſo many young Women ſuffer many fowl Cenſures for having a large proportion of Beauty; whilſt other Women, that are very far from being handſom, live very far from Scandals, tho' perhaps not free from deſerving them.</p>
               <p>And now Reader, I have mention'd a few of the many Arts and deceitful words, young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants uſe to deceive their Miſtreſſes with; give me leave but only to name a few of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excuſes or rather juſtifications, divers of their Miſtreſſes (tho perhaps other Mens Wives)
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38135:33"/>alledg in their own Defence and Juſtification, and with them ſeem fully ſatisfied, tho' their Friends and Relations are far from being ſo, to whom they owe a reſpect and ought to have a concern for, tho' they receive no Maintenance from; and when once an Amour between a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and her Gallant comes to flame out, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view, and ſo makes common Diſcourſe, it muſt come at laſt to her Friends and Kindreds Ears; for they cannot but hear, what all ſpeak aloud to her Shame, and their Diſcredit, which muſt make them troubled at it, and be much concern'd for her, tho' perhaps ſhes not in the leaſt for her ſelf, and therefore when her Friends and Kindred come to diſcourſe and argue with her about it, and aſſure her, tho' her, Intentions be never ſo innocent and virtuous, yet her keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much Company with ſuch a Man cannot but raiſe ſcandalous Cenſures and ill Reflections upon their Credit and her Reputation; but ſhe to this part of their Accuſation, ſeems more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed at what they ſay, than at what ſhe does, and inſtead of ſinking into a Fit of Repentance for her own Deeds, ſhe ſwells into a Fit of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at their Words, in queſtioning her virtuous Life and diſcreet carriage, proteſting ſhe does not in the leaſt deſerve her Friends ill Opinion, or the Worlds bad Cenſure, and therefore ſays, ſhe has good reaſon to exclaim againſt their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Jealouſy of her, and ſharp Language to her, vowing ſhe never led but a pure innocent Life in all her Thoughts, Words and Actions with that Man they accuſe her of, and condemn her for, there having never been other than a pure Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick Love and Friendſhip deſign'd by her, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38135:34"/>ſhe verily believes intended by him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, inſtead of excuſing her carriage to him, ſhe falls upon extolling and magnifying his great Civility to her, how obliging and friendly he ſtill ſhewed himſelf in all her Concerns, on all Occaſions, and that with much Frankneſs, high Diſcretion, great Reality, and abundance of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity; and as long as his Viſits were kept in the bounds of ſtrict Virtue and true Civility, ſhe cannot any way conceive, how her keeping company with him, can in the leaſt bring a diſhonour to her Self, or Family; and therefore ſhe ought not to be ſo barbarouſly ill-natur'd and ungratefully unjuſt, as to withdraw her harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Converſation and juſtifiable Friendſhip to this her Friend, by forbidding him viſiting her, ſince that were in effect to proclaim to the World the falſeneſs of his Love, and the ſcandal of his Company, and by it all may conclude, That he has either ſpoke ill of her Reputation, or has acted ſome rudeneſs to her Perſon already, or that ſhe hath reaſon to fear he will do it hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore has for bid him her Company, either upon the account of revenge for whats paſt, or by the way of prevention for the time to come; therefore, I am clear of opinion, a Woman ought not to forbid an old Friend and Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance viſiting her, except it be upon one of theſe two nam'd Accounts, or elſe upon the ſcore that ſhe has reaſon to believe her Husband does not well relliſh his coming ſo often to her; and if that be the Buſineſs, if this her Friend be what he really pretends to be, and ſhe ſeems to believe he is, he cannot juſtly take it ill that ſhe freely tells him, That his viſiting her ſo conſtantly,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38135:34"/>tho' their Converſe be never ſo Vertuous and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, yet ſhe has ſome cauſe to fear, it has, or may, if long continued, raiſe her Husbands Diſlike, and the Worlds Cenſure; therefore, to prevent both, and ſecure her own Quiet, and good Reputation, ſhe friendly deſires him, for the future, to make his Viſits ſhorter, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domer, to ſtop all buſy ill-natured Cenſurers Tongues, and any Jealouſies their malicious Twatlings might raiſe in her Husbands Mind: And ſure if this her dear eſteemed Friend truly deſerves that Title, he muſt value her Honour as part of his own, and make her Content his Satisfaction, ſince ſhe freely and heartily aſſures him, 'tis not at all upon the account of her leſſening her true Eſteem and Friendſhip for him, but meerly to ſecure her Husbands Love and Kindneſs to her, that ſhe deſires this of him.</p>
               <p>Next, I ſhall adviſe that Woman who ſtands ſo much on her inward Vertue, as to ſlight her Friends Advice, and the Worlds Cenſure for keeping her Friend ſo much company, ſeriouſly to conſider, That 'tis above the power of any Mortal, to dive into a Womans inward Thoughts, and that Men can only behold her outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not inward Intentions: For tho' Men can ſee her Lips move, when ſhe whiſpers, yet they cannot tell, what ſhe ſpeaks when ſhe does ſo. Much leſs are they able to dive into either of their Meanings; for that's ſo great a ſecret, as one of them may deceive the other with for all their Vows and Oaths of an open Heart, a true Love, and an unalterable Friendſhip.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:38135:35"/>
               <p>I could name a thouſand Arts, Slights and Deceits, that many Gallants uſe to their Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but I am ſure I ſhould ſooner tire my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Patience with their great numbers, than by their great numbers to confirm his belief of their great Truth, except it be the Truth of their great Folly and vile Falſity; for indeed moſt of the young Gallants of our preſent ſober and Vertuous Age, do commonly in their Courtſhip to their preſent Miſtreſſes, carry little Truth in their Heart, but many more Romantick Lies on their Tongues than Teeth in their Mouth.</p>
               <p>And now, Reader, pray give me leave to change a little the Scene of my Diſcourſe of the great Beauty of the Miſtreſſes, to add a word of the great and wicked actings of ſome of their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, who having tried all arts and means they could invent to gain their Miſtreſſes Heart (I ſtill except Marriage) and after all their Eſſays, find it ſo ſtrongly fortified, and fully Garriſon'd with Vertue and Piety, as they ſee it impregnable againſt all their Batteries and Aſſaults, ſo as to caſt themſelves into an utter deſpair of ever gaining their wicked ends on them; I ſay, can any Man of common Senſe, not think it full time for him to found a Retreat as to following their Perſons, tho' he cannot leave admiring their Beauty? Indeed I have ever obſerved that Importunity ſtill breeds Trouble; but I never heard, it ever created Love in a Miſtreſs. Yet this ſort of wicked, fooliſh Gallants are ſo inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable in the folly of their endleſs Purſuit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Miſtreſs, as they will not believe they hate them, tho' their Words and Actions declare their ſcorn and averſion to them; but they will
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38135:35"/>tell you, whats three Kicks of denial to a Lover that has read the Patience of <hi>Job,</hi> or the ſober Temper of <hi>Seneca,</hi> or has often experimented the Inconſtancy and Fickleneſs of an ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored Miſtreſs, which perhaps exceeds both? And therefore, by way of Revenge he quickly reſolves, rather than be publickly ridiculed for miſſing his aim, loſing his time, and not gaining his Miſtreſs, ſince he cannot enjoy her fair Perſon, he will endeavour blaſting her good Name, and make the World believe ſhe's kind to him, tho' ſhe's only really ſo to her own Virtue and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, by deſpiſing him, and all his Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and the better to accompliſh his baſe and treacherous Deſign on her, he alters his Courſe, changes his Battery, and comes and throws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his Virtuous Miſtreſſes Feet, with the greateſt ſeeming Joy imaginable, That God has ſo bleſſed him, as he is now become an intire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Convert, who has abandoned all the vain Pleaſures of this World, to contemplate the pure and endleſs Felicities of Heaven; and that now, inſtead of being a Slave to the Beauty of her Body, he is become a devout well-wiſher to the good of her Soul: And intends to be ſo vile an Hypocrite and wicked a Sinner, that ſince he could not gain her Body by all earthly means, he reſolves to flie to Heaven it ſelf for a religious diſguiſe to ruin her Reputation, and ſatisfy his Revenge, ſince he could not his Love; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he now only pretends to pure Piety, ſtrict Virtue, true Humility, much Gravity, and great Penitency in all his Diſcourſes and Actions (I mean before her only) and ſeriouſly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly proteſteth to her (for in this Diſguiſe he dares not Swear) that he highly rejoyceth
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:38135:36"/>that all the Courtſhip he made, and Perſwaſions he uſed, ſerved only to try her Humour, not tempt her Virtue, which he now highly rejoyces to find proof againſt all Temptations, Vowing to her he is now more delighted with the true Virtue of her Mind, than ever he was formerly taken with the great Beauty of her Face; for the firſt is pure and Heavenly, the laſt meer ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual; the firſt reliſheth of Angel-Love, the ſecond may, and often does, ſavour of meer bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Luſt: And thus, whilſt he makes up all his Diſcourſes in praiſing and magnifying her great Virtue to her ſelf, he uſes all baſe, oblique and ſubtle Endeavours, and underhand Arts of Defamation, to brand and blemiſh her good Name to all others, and thus hopes to obtain his baſe revengful Ends, by a Holy and Heavenly means. And in purſuit of this his baſe wicked and Treacherous Deſign, he entertains her, with how highly he is delighted that he has quite ſtript himſelf of the Fools-Coat of a vain amorous Lover, to Cloath himſelf with the pious ſober Dreſs of a holy Convert, and a Devout Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; and that he now does, and ever will, make it his hearty Prayers, real Endeavours, and main Concern, to keep her, as well as himſelf, always full of Heavenly Contemplations of the other World, by an intire forſaking and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating all the Wickedneſs and Vanities of this; and by this mounting her mind above, he hopes the eaſier to delude her Thoughts here below, and ſo to make her not to value any of this World's concerns, and to over-look earthly Cenſures, as being things all pious Chriſtians muſt of courſe meet with, in this their earthly Pilgrimage, not on the account of any particular affliction and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment

And thus he entertains her, or rather amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes her, with heavenly Contemplations, and a meer ſeeming pure religious Platonick Friendſhip, that he may, by his good and pious converſation, repair often, talk much, and vifit long, unmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by her, but much obſerv'd, and highly cenſur'd by all others, who ſee his long and often Viſits to her, but hear not her religious Diſcourſes with him, or his to her; and by this baſe, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Diſguiſe, he hopes others will think him Maſter of her Body, whilſt he pretends to her, to be only a devout Servant to her Soul, and pleaſeth himſelf by putting a religious Cheat on her pious Meanings and virtuous Actions, and makes uſe of God's good Name, only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her a bad one.</p>
               <p>There is a remarkable Story, ſomething of this nature, to be read in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> of a moſt rare Lady in <hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>Paulina,</hi> who was much renown'd for her high Birth, great Virtue, admirable Wit, charming Beauty, abundant Wealth, tranſcendent Wiſdom and Diſcretion; and as an addition to all theſe, ſhe was in the very prime and Bloſſom of her Age; and what's yet ſtronger than all theſe, ſhe was reverenc'd by all, as a Mirror of Chaſtity; and that ſo many rare Qualities ſhould all center in one Woman, where there's hardly one of them to be found in many Women, I am ſure is not one of the ſmalleſt Miracles in <hi>Rome,</hi> which could never be nam'd the Holy City upon the account of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny holy and virtuous Women in it; for in <hi>Rome</hi> all know Miracles are very plenty, but chaſt Women very ſcarce, and ſo are indeed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38135:37"/>chaſt Clergy-Men; for the younger fort of them love more to make many handſom Women unvirtuous, but reprove few, if any, for being ſo, or Penancing them that they are ſo. This admirable <hi>Paulina,</hi> was married to a young Noble Man, that well match'd her in all her Excellencies, and Virtues. He was called <hi>Saturnam.</hi> There was a perſon of great eſteem, nam'd <hi>Decius Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> that fell deſperately in love with her, but could not corrupt her, ſo as to enjoy her one Night, with all the Arts he could uſe, and vaſt Proffers he did offer to the value of two hundred thouſand Drachmas, which in our Mony amounts to about ſix thouſand Pounds; but after having found all his Eſſays of gaining her, fruitleſs, her Heart being impregnable, he fell into ſo great a Melancholy, and ſo deep a Deſpair, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, ſince, he could not feaſt himſelf on her Beauty, he would Starve himſelf to Death, to be deliver'd from the Tyranny of his violent Love-paſſion for her, that ſo tormented him; but a Woman, call'd <hi>Ida,</hi> being much troubled he ſhould undergo ſuch a ſad Death, went to him and deſir'd him not to die with Deſpair, for ſhe had thought of a means, that for fifty thouſand Drachmas, which ſhe would ſo diſpoſe as a Bribe, that he ſhould enjoy his dear <hi>Paulina:</hi> To accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh which, ſhe practiſed this ſubtil, but wicked Policy, by addreſſing her ſelf to a Prieſt of the Temple, who upon her large Promiſes and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of great Sums (which is ſtill a prevailing Argument among the Popiſh Clergy) ſhe laid him down 25000 Drachmas, and ingaging to him as much more as ſoon as he had perform'd what ſhe deſired. She then acquainted him with the violent Love-paſſion <hi>Mundus</hi> had for <hi>Paulina,</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:38135:37"/>begging him to contrive ſome way that he might enjoy her, or elſe he could not long enjoy his own Life: The Prieſt, poſſeſſed with the great Sum ſhe gave him, and the much more that ſhe engaged to give him, promiſed, That <hi>Mundus</hi> ſhould enjoy <hi>Paulina</hi> for a whole Night; And he having free acceſs to her, deſired he might ſpeak with her in private, which ſhe readily granted him, who told her, he was ſent by the God <hi>Anubis,</hi> who was much inamored with her charming Beauty, and deſired that ſhe would give him a meeting that night. This Diſcourſe ſo pleaſed <hi>Paulina,</hi> as ſhe could not forbear telling ſome of her intimate Friends how ſhe had been honoured with an amorous ſollicitation of a God, (for tho' ſhe was an excellent Woman, yet ſhe was ſtill a Woman, and conſequently vain and proud of her Beauty.) <hi>Paulina</hi> thought fit, in the firſt place, to acquaint her Husband, how God <hi>Anubis</hi> had ſent that he would come to her, which her Husband conſented to, relying on her great Chaſtity; ſhe therefore, after ſhe had ſupp'd at her uſual hour, repair'd to the Temple, and in the Prieſt his Houſe ſhe went to bed, and the Gates being by the Prieſt ſhut and the Lights in her Chamber taken away, <hi>Mundus,</hi> that was hid in the Chamber, failed not to accoſt her, who ſhe thought was God <hi>Anubis.</hi> By this art of his and miſtake of hers, <hi>Mundus</hi> ſatisfied his wicked luſtful deſire of her all that Night, and early in the morning before the Prieſts were ſtirring (who were privy to the Treachery,) he retired himſelf, and <hi>Paulina</hi> alſo returned early in the morning to her Husband, and acquainted him how God <hi>Anubis</hi> had appeared unto her, and made her boaſt to ſome of her familiar Friends,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38135:38"/>what conference he had uſed with her, which ſome of them could not believe; others were amazed at it, conſidering her great Chaſtity. About three days after, <hi>Mundus</hi> meeting <hi>Paulina,</hi> told her, ſhe had ſaved him two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Drachmas, which ſhe might have put in her Treaſure; but, ſaid he, I am not much troubled that you contemned me under the name of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> ſince I have ſatisfied my deſire by enjoying you under the Name of <hi>Anubis;</hi> and ſo left her. She amazed at his high Impudence, and vexed at her own Misfortune, tore her Garments, and went and told her Husband of <hi>Mundus</hi> his baſe, wicked and ſubtile Deceit, and begged his aſſiſtance in the proſecution of her Revenge; and preſently acquainted the Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> of every particular of their vile Treachery; who after a ſtrict examination of the Prieſts concerning this baſe foul Fact, he condemned them and <hi>Ida</hi> the contriver of the Plot againſt <hi>Paulina,</hi> to be all hanged, the Temple to be pulled down, the Statue of <hi>Anubis</hi> to be caſt into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Tiber,</hi> and <hi>Mundus</hi> to be baniſhed.</p>
               <p>This ſad Story teacheth all Women this good Doctrin, That they are not to grant a Man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Opportunities, tho' upon never ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Pretences, witneſs this wicked Cheat practiſed on the Virtuous <hi>Paulina.</hi> The meſſage ſent to meet him, was no leſs than faom a God: The Meſſenger that brought it was no worſe than a Prieſt of the Temple; ſhe had her Husband's free conſent to juſtify her, and her own pure Innocence to protect her; yet when ſhe lay that Night from her Husband, ſhe ſtray'd that Night from her Prudence, by fancying a God had more need or deſire to have her appear to him in Bed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38135:38"/>out of her Houſe, than up and dreſt in it; but it ſeems the Name of a God had a charming power to deceive a Mortal Woman, when vaſt Gifts, large Promiſes, and the moſt ſubtile Arts could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, which I may well ſay again is a Pattern uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to inſtruct Women. This prudent Caution, not to truſt Men with over-great Liberties and unuſual Opportunities, tho' they bow down their Knees to the Ground, and lift up their Eyes to Heaven, humbly to make God a Witneſs of their unalterable Conſtancy and real Affection, I ſay a Wiſe, Virtuous Woman ought not to rely on either, ſince there may be Deceit in both.</p>
               <p>Really as a Virtuous Wife cannot be too cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and careful to maintain a good Reputation, ſo ſhe cannot be too wary and watchful to avoid a bad one, and conſequently to ſhun Mens Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the grand occaſion of it, ſince more hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Women loſe their Reputation by being publickly courted, than by being privately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; for tho' the one is but a high Folly, the other a great Sin, yet the firſt raiſes a publick Scandal, whilſt the other is but a private Crime between themſelves, and cannot be talked of by many, becauſe known but by few; and indeed 'tis held by divers Men, a meaſuring caſt, and a diſputable queſtion, which is worſe, a Wife that's inwardly Virtuous, but outwardly in diſcreet, or a Wife that's outwardly diſcreet, but not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Virtuous: I dare not undertake to tell you which is the beſt of the two, but I am ſure they are both bad; yet I fancy the firſt is leſs ill, ſince 'tis doubtleſs a greater crime to offend God, than injure Men, a Scandal not being ſo bad as a Sin; for a Scandal may riſe only for breaking a Country Cuſtom, but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38135:39"/>a ſin, can only riſe from breaking a heavenly Command.</p>
               <p>A Wife that's outwardly ſcandalous in her carriage, tho' never ſo inwardly Vertuous in her intentions, yet that can give no ſatisfaction, or make any reparation to her Husbands Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for if a Mans Wife be generally report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faulty, 'tis the ſame to her Husbands Honour, as if ſhe were really ſo; for tho' her inward Virtue and Innocency is hers, yet the ſcandal of the ill report is his, ſo that the Wives being free from the Sin, does not clear the Husband from the ſhame. Now of all that I have writ, good Wives ought to make this Concluſion, that ſince 'tis not a Womans Innocency of Life, but her diſcreet living in the ſight of the World, that muſt preſerve, or ruin her Reputation in it, and as much of her Husbands Honour, as relates to it, this Conſequence muſt needs be undeniable, that a good Wife is as well obliged to live diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly on her Husbands account, as ſhe is bound to live Virtuouſly on her own, and to be truly careful, ſtrictly diligent, and purely modeſt in all her Looks, Words, and Actions towards Men, ſince as you juſt read before, many Men are ſo very falſe, treacherous and wicked, that if they cannot by all earthly means gain their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes kindneſs, they will fly to Heaven it ſelf for a diſguiſe to ruin their Reputation.</p>
               <p>Therefore that Wife that is truly Virtuous, and that truly reſolves to continue ſo, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be by all thought ſuch, muſt not only avoid doing what's really ill, but what's ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imprudent; and ſo may occaſion, tho' not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve cenſure, and in order thereunto ſhe's to avoid all ſcandalous company of either Sex, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:38135:39"/>not only to ſhun all Sin, but all Inviters to it, or Patterns of it; for evil Communication not only corrupts good Manners, but creates a bad Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; therefore a Virtuous Wife muſt not only abſtain from making an intimacy with, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Viſits from, ſuch as are branded with a general ill Reputation; for 'tis a fault to keep company with ſuch as are commonly eſteemed to be faulty; for that Woman that truly hates ſuch Womens Vices will Shun their Company for their Vices ſake; for as Virtue is only followed by the Virtuous, ſo Vice is only by the vicious, ſo that a good Wife ought to be diſcreet as well as virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſince if ſhe be not the one, ſhe will hardly paſs for the other; and 'tis much to be doubted, that ſhe that will not keep in the Bounds of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet outward Carriage, will hardly contain her ſelf in the Limits of a pure inward Virtue. Laſtly, ſince Self-intereſt (to ſpeak moderately) governs the greateſt part of the World in all things, ſure it ought to govern all good Women in this one thing, eſpecially ſince 'tis ſo much for their advantage, which none can deny, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders, that 'tis a certain Rule, and a common Practice, that ſhe that Cenſures others, muſt expect that others will Cenſure her, for in this rule, there is rarely any favour ſhewed, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect given; and therefore a Prudent Woman cannot but eſteem it both reaſonable and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to believe that by paſſing ſharp Cenſures on others, whether they do much, little, or not at all deſerve them, yet they are ſtill received, and often returned, by thoſe they are intended for, and level'd at, with great Anger, bitter Malice, and ſharp Revenge; for tho' they fall on thoſe that are truly faulty, and ſo juſtly deſerve them,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38135:40"/>yet that hinders not ſuch from being tranſported with Fury againſt the Reporters of them; for tho' many Women love to commit faults, yet moſt hate to be told they do.</p>
               <p>And if you blame and cenſure thoſe whoſe good and virtuous Life no way deſerves ſuch ſharp Cenſures, they will be ſure to be incenſed againſt you for unjuſtly accuſing them, ſo that both Good, and Bad will be angry to be ill ſpoke of; and this methinks ſhould diſſwade all Women, that pretend to Wiſdom and Diſcretion, to avoid ſcandalizing any; for if you ſpeak ill of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as on your own knowledg, and yet do not certainly know it, you commit a diveliſh fault, by telling a Lie, and ſo raiſe a Bliſter on your own Tongue, by endeavouring to raiſe a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal on her Fame; and if you report Scandalous things of a Woman as Truth, only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of hearing them from others, 'tis very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible you tell a Lye at 2d Hand, by telling that as a Truth, which you are not certain is ſo; therefore, 'tis my advice to all Ladies to root out of their practice, this baſe, tho' modiſh Crime of Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which will do you hurt, but can never do you good; for you will always get Hatred for it, but never gain Love by it; ſo that indeed the beſt and moſt prudent Courſe, is, that of perſons you cannot ſpeak well of, be ſilent, and rather make their Faults the ſubject of your Trouble, than that of your Diſcourſe, or the exerciſe of your Wit, which is in truth, but the practice of your Malice: And as Cheating can never make a part of true Wiſdom, ſo ill Nature can never make a part of good Wit; and indeed Women may rely upon this as almoſt an infallible Rule, that thoſe that delight in Cenſuring others before you, will as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38135:40"/>in cenſuring you before others, aſſoon as your back is turned. In a word, thoſe that take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſcandalizing others, whether it be to make Diſcourſe, or to ſhew Wit, or to vent Malice, 'tis not only Unjuſt and Unhandſom, but 'tis what's worſe than both, irreligious and deceitful, if you will take St <hi>James</hi>'s word for it, for he ſays, <hi>If any among you ſeemeth Religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, he deceiveth his own Heart, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is vain,</hi> James 1.26.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, give me leave to mind you again, that ſhe that will cenſure others, muſt expect others will cenſure her; and you know that one that fights many, muſt needs fight upon great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; ſo in matter of Cenſures and Scandals ſhe that provokes many Tongues to Shoot at her own ſingle Reputation, thoſe many are much likelier to wound her, than ſhe to wound thoſe many; ſince ſhe that ſhoots at the Reputation of great numbers of Women, 'tis improbable ſhe ſhould hit all; but if great numbers ſhoot all at one, 'tis very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that one ſhould be miſſed by all; ſo that 'tis unfafe as well as unreaſonable and imprudent for any one; Woman to provoke many Women Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to caſt ſharp. Cenſures on her, meerly out of her uncertain hopes to caſt Scandals on them.</p>
               <p>And Cenſurer diſguiſe your malicious ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with the pureſt Gloſs, and the beſt Wit you can: You ſhall never make it paſs for true Wiſdom and good Policy, to forfeit your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to exerciſe your Wit; Therefore if your Prudence and Diſcretion cannot hinder you from ingaging in ſuch an unequal Cambat, as one Tongue muſt be to fight againſt many, pray let Self-intereſt, upon the account of ſelf-preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſſuade you from it; and remember, to be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:38135:41"/>worſted in fight is ſtill diſgraceful, as well as to be victorious, is ever glorious: Therefore, rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Prudence, than practiſe Malice; and rather conceal your Wit, than divulge your Envy, or exerciſe your ill Nature; and ſince foul cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ever bad, ſtill remember, you can never ſhew good Wit, by doing an ill thing.</p>
               <p>And now, Reader, to conclude all in one word (for I know I have reaſon to believe that I have already writ too many, to tire your Patience, tho' perhaps not to convince your opinion,) that a virtuous Woman ought to avoid publick Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as well as private Sins; and to ſhun as much getting an ill Name, as committing a bad Act. Now to prevent both, let all your Thoughts be good, and all your Words and Actions diſcreet and Un-cenſorious, that tho' the Beauty of your Perſon, may cauſe ſome that are unvirtuous, to wiſh you ſo, yet let the Piety of your Life, and the Prudence of your Carriage, cauſe all ſuch that are truly Religious and ſtrictly Virtuous, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port you to be the like; and make it always your great care, and conſtant concern, that you never ſcandalize any, and your great trouble, that any ſhould ever ſcandalize you; for let a Woman be never ſo purely virtuous, and free from deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bad Cenſures, yet ſhe muſt be unfortunate in receiving them; for ſcandalous Reports muſt hurt a good Womans Reputation, tho' ſhe does not deſerve them; as well as wound a wicked Womans Conſcience, that does.</p>

                  <hi>THE THIRD DISCOURSE,</hi> Of young <hi>Mens</hi> great <hi>folly,</hi> in ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and over-praiſing all young handſome <hi>Ladies;</hi> and their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>folly</hi> in receiving it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them.</head>
               <p>'TIS not more natural for heat to attend <hi>Fire,</hi> nor more common for the <hi>Sun</hi> to exhale vapours from the <hi>Earth,</hi> than 'tis for great <hi>Beauty</hi> to attract high Praiſes from young Men; and truly ſuch of them, as have wit to ſpare, time to loſe, favour to hope for, and no other world to think of, are fitteſt to Court their Beauty in this, which is but modiſh breeding, and ſuitable to moſt mens practice and all handſom <hi>Ladies</hi> expectation, I do not ſay merit.</p>
               <p>And ſuch <hi>Men</hi> as are pretenders to <hi>raillying</hi> wit, and <hi>French</hi> breeding, may ſhew both, by entertaining them with Courtly Harangs, all ſet out with high Praiſes, and great Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (which few <hi>Men</hi> ſpeak as their belief, but moſt <hi>Ladies</hi> receive as their deſert,) and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38135:42"/>with ſuch <hi>Idolizing poſtures,</hi> and <hi>Dying expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as if they deſign'd their fellow Creatures to be perfect <hi>Goddeſſes,</hi> who were made like <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>'s golden Image, only to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped; ſo naturally agreeable are ſuch <hi>ſinful</hi> adorations to vain <hi>Ladies,</hi> as the firſt <hi>temptation</hi> we read of in <hi>Scripture</hi> that ever prevail'd on <hi>Woman,</hi> was that of being made <hi>like to God,</hi> and that <hi>Woman</hi> then compriz'd in her ſelf, the whole <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Women</hi> kind; and indeed 'tis very probable, that her aſpiring preſumption then to more knowledge than ſhe ought, does ſtill puniſh <hi>moſt</hi> of her Sex with leſs <hi>Wiſdom</hi> than they need.</p>
               <p>Really if <hi>handſom Ladies</hi> had but that ſhare of Prudence which they ought to have as good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and to uſe in the practical part of Chriſtianity, to which all Women are called, (though few ſtrive to be choſen) they would never endure, much leſs countenance, ſuch young <hi>Men</hi> to Court and magnifie them at ſuch an <hi>extravagant rate,</hi> as to preſent them with that Compoſition of <hi>Praiſes,</hi> meerly for vain <hi>paſtime,</hi> or what's worſe, evil ends, which ought to be attributed to <hi>divine Worſhip</hi> only; nor can there be a more clear and plainer Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove <hi>Womens</hi> want of wiſdom, then that many of them will receive ſuch profane <hi>Praiſes,</hi> not as the vain <hi>Effects</hi> of young Mens wicked <hi>folly,</hi> but as the deſerved <hi>Trophies</hi> of their own conquering beauty and merit. All I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38135:42"/>ſhall ſay is, that ſuch courtly Incenſe, ſuits well with ſuch a vain falſe Deity, and that ſuch young Women are as fooliſhly guilty in receiving ſuch vain Attributes, as ſuch young Men are highly profane in offering them:</p>
               <p>Thus Men by the deceitful reflexes of high praiſes, divert young <hi>Women</hi> from <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring their Creator in the days of their Youth,</hi> and poſſibly all the time of their Life, by Charming them with their own Charms, and diſguiſing themſelves, to themſelves; and by telling them ſo often what they are not, makes them forget what they really are; and by theſe means they advance their minds ſo far above any diſmal thoughts of their own mortality, that truly few of our young cry'd up beauties now adays, ſcarce hears any thing of <hi>Death,</hi> but what they are <hi>Romanticly told</hi> their own <hi>killing beauty</hi> does occaſion, though in truth, if we read the <hi>Weekly Bills</hi> of <hi>Mortality,</hi> we <hi>ſhall</hi> find that the effects of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> kill many more, than the <hi>paſſion</hi> of Love; Men being often Angry with many Men at once, but never in Love with more than one Woman at a time, and that one it ſelf, is too many by one.</p>
               <p>But my deſign being not to Court the young <hi>Ladies</hi> with high Complements, but to ſerve them with great reality, I muſt aſſure them that theſe <hi>high praiſes,</hi> the more they are truſted, the more they'll betray, and the more you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38135:43"/>
                  <hi>Ladies</hi> confide in their worth, the more you'll be deceiv'd in their value; ſo that it follows by the plain <hi>Rule</hi> of common reaſon, that ſo much as you deduct of Mens overpraiſes, ſo much you leſſen of your own ſelf deceivings. Indeed theſe poyſoned <hi>Darts</hi> of praiſes, have got ſuch a predominant power over moſt young handſom Women, (and the moſt handſom, are moſt ſubject to them,) that moſt of them are in danger of being wounded by them, becauſe the peril of <hi>flattery</hi> ſtill mounts with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>beauty,</hi> as the <hi>Suns heat</hi> ſtill increaſes proportionable as it riſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flattery</hi> and vain-glorious <hi>praiſes</hi> are both inſinuating <hi>Devils,</hi> two <hi>Twins</hi> begot by the <hi>father</hi> of Lies, and theſe not only attempt all, but poſſeſs moſt vain handſom <hi>Ladies;</hi> and therefore they ought above all, to be very ſtrict, and diligently active, to ſhun ſuch tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe, and avoid ſuch dangerous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or at leaſt when with them, to be ſure ſtill to carry about them S. <hi>James</hi> his good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and antidote, <hi>reſiſt the Devil, and he will flie from you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Really if young <hi>Ladies</hi> would but take a ſteddy reſolution to reſiſt and ſlight all young <hi>Mens</hi> vain Courtſhips, and place no ſuch high <hi>eſtimation</hi> on their <hi>own beauty,</hi> they would <hi>eaſily</hi> do the like on mens <hi>praiſes,</hi> and by this means young <hi>Gallants</hi> would ſlacken in their <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi> proportionable to the young <hi>Ladies</hi> cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38135:43"/>in their receptions of it, and ſo make Men deſpiſe Womens beauty, ſuitable to their ſlighting <hi>Mens</hi> Love, and thus Womens pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, would become Mens wiſdom, for in real truth, 'tis hope of gain makes love <hi>Merchants</hi> as well as others; none watch <hi>Bees</hi> but for their <hi>Hony,</hi> and few Court fair <hi>Ladies</hi> but for ſome hopes of a return; and therefore you never hear of any of the young <hi>Sparks</hi> that plant their <hi>Love Batteries</hi> againſt <hi>Nunneries,</hi> not becauſe they think the young Women in them have too little beauty, but becauſe they believe they ſhall meet there with too great a reſiſtance, by the care they take, and ſtrictneſs they uſe, to prevent Mens making any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes and near <hi>approaches</hi> to them: for as Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> ſays, <hi>a well govern'd heart, like rich</hi> China, admits <hi>Men</hi> only to the <hi>Frontier</hi> part; for a ſtrict vertue ſets certain bounds to young handſom <hi>Womens</hi> carriage and behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men, which they are not to exceed; as the <hi>Almighty</hi> gave to the Sea, ſo far you ſhall go, and no farther.</p>
               <p>And though I know there's no ſuch thing now adays in practice <hi>among our young Men, as Angel Love, which is the pure Commerce of the Souls,</hi> yet I believe <hi>Venus Love</hi> does not rage ſo very much, nor is its infection ſo very ſtrong and rife, as <hi>Cenſurers</hi> would fain have it, making our <hi>Age much worſe</hi> than 'tis, when <hi>God knows</hi> 'tis but too bad, at beſt; as if the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38135:44"/>youth of both Sexes were now ſo corrupt, as that a <hi>young Gentleman</hi> cannot viſit a <hi>young Lady,</hi> nor a young Lady receive viſits from a young Gentleman, without imputation of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, or the cenſure of ill and vicious deſigns on both ſides; tho I verily believe, <hi>ſome young Men,</hi> (I do not ſay <hi>all,</hi> nor yet many) love <hi>Womens</hi> company, and <hi>Women</hi> Mens, on no other account than for their great wit, good humor, and agreeable Converſation, without any farther ends.</p>
               <p>And now I am beginning to enter into that part of this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> which principally <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes it ſelf to the</hi> handſom <hi>young Maiden Ladies,</hi> and chiefly among them, to ſuch as are innocently and modeſtly bred, for ſuch ſort of <hi>young Women</hi> often entertain diſcourſes, and make acquaintances with <hi>young Men,</hi> without the leaſt thought of love, or deſign of ill, many of them looking civilly, and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely to them, on no other account, than to ſhew and exerciſe their wit, and that may be more to pleaſe their own fancy, than on deſign to take that of others; but yet I muſt adviſe ſuch <hi>young Women</hi> to conſider, that meer <hi>civil looks</hi> often tempt, and <hi>refuſals</hi> may be given after ſuch a manner, as may rather embolden one to ask more, than to beg pardon for having asked too much; for as one well obſerves of ſtrict vertuous Women, <hi>That Man comes too near to them, that comes to be denied
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38135:44"/>by them.</hi> Indeed 'tis not <hi>very</hi> rare now a days, for <hi>civil looks</hi> in young Women to breed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous</hi> thoughts in young Men, for the <hi>Goſpel tells us that there is an Adultery of the Eye,</hi> and I am ſure we ought all to remember with <hi>grief of mind,</hi> that aſſoon as the <hi>Serpent</hi> had perſwaded that the <hi>forbidden fruit</hi> was pleaſant to the <hi>Eye,</hi> it ſoon follow'd that it became delightful to the <hi>Taſt;</hi> if Mens Vows of Love, and Oaths of Conſtancy, can but once tempt young <hi>Maids appetites to taſte,</hi> 'twill ſoon make them anticipate their <hi>fears to eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Ladies</hi> have a care of receiving Mens praiſes and flatteries, and though you believe your own Vertue never ſo ſtrong, and yours Lovers Courtſhip never ſo innocent, as poſſibly they may be at firſt received by you, and deſign'd by him, only as the effects of pure <hi>civility,</hi> and not of any ill <hi>intention;</hi> yet prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſo naturally agreeable to vain handſom <hi>Ladies,</hi> as they often unperceiv'd inſinuate, and wind themſelves ſo about their hearts, as to kindle there by degrees Love <hi>likings,</hi> though perhaps they do not feel ſo much as the leaſt ſlight <hi>atome</hi> Love to creep on the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of their <hi>heart; Love</hi> ſometimes like a <hi>Tortoiſe</hi> makes its way, though it does not ſeem to <hi>ſtir,</hi> or like the hand of a <hi>Watch,</hi> which though you cannot perceive to move, yet you may plainly ſee its hourly <hi>advances; Love</hi> often
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38135:45"/>growing in <hi>young</hi> Womens minds, as <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> do in their bodies, without ever giving the leaſt Alarm or Advertiſement of its approach, till it breaks out into a dangerous fit of <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>a ſoft word breaks the Bone,</hi> therefore no wonder if <hi>ſmooth</hi> praiſes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements ſhould charm a young Ladies tender heart; for ſure 'tis no wonderful operation in <hi>our times,</hi> for ſmall <hi>freedoms like little Thieves</hi> to <hi>open</hi> the <hi>Doors</hi> to great <hi>Liberties,</hi> and <hi>venial wantonneſs,</hi> to turn to <hi>modiſh wickedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore let <hi>me</hi> adviſe the vain <hi>Ladies,</hi> not to deceive themſelves in fancying that they are more <hi>invincible</hi> in their Love <hi>railleries,</hi> in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> praiſes <hi>from young Men,</hi> than <hi>King Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was with <hi>dallying</hi> with ſtrange Women, which <hi>drew</hi> him <hi>into</hi> the Sin of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> This example may ſerve as a Caution to young <hi>Ladies,</hi> not to relie too much on their own <hi>ſtrength;</hi> for many <hi>Maids hearts,</hi> like <hi>ſtrong Fortreſſes,</hi> have been loſt by too great a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency upon their own ſtrength, and too mean an undervaluing of others attempts againſt them: I ſhall therefore <hi>adviſe</hi> all young <hi>Ladies,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Virgins,</hi> by no means on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to ſuffer their <hi>beauty</hi> to lie under the <hi>preſſing</hi> temptations of <hi>young Mens</hi> high praiſes, and conſtant Courtſhip which often enflames them beyond their own natural temper and ſtrength; for continual <hi>blowing,</hi> is able to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38135:45"/>in time, <hi>a great Fire out of a little Spark:</hi> And alſo young handſom <hi>Women</hi> ought to avoid giving or receiving any favourable attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting looks from young <hi>Men;</hi> for the <hi>Eye</hi> is as well the <hi>Pulſe</hi> of the Mind, as the <hi>Door</hi> of the Heart, and no Love <hi>flames</hi> can enter into the heart, but it muſt firſt enter the <hi>Eye,</hi> as we ſee the <hi>Sun</hi> it ſelf, ſtill ſends his <hi>light,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he brings his <hi>heat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next <hi>Ladies</hi> remember that the <hi>Scripture</hi> couples <hi>with the luſt of the Eye,</hi> the <hi>pride of Life,</hi> as a leſſon to teach you, that you ought as much to well order your <hi>looks,</hi> as to regulate your <hi>lives</hi> which you may perform much the eaſier and better, if you will but ſeriouſly reflect on the ways and means <hi>young Gallants</hi> uſe in making their approaches towards gaining their <hi>Miſtriſſes;</hi> (I do not here intend as to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them <hi>Miſtriſſes</hi> in order to being <hi>Wives</hi> but <hi>Miſſes</hi>) which is uſually after this kind of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; firſt they preſent them with <hi>ſwarms</hi> of Praiſes and Complements, thick garniſhed with great <hi>Oaths</hi> and repeated <hi>Vows,</hi> of a never <hi>dying love,</hi> and a never <hi>failing conſtancy,</hi> and all attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſad <hi>looks,</hi> deep <hi>ſighs,</hi> and humble <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures;</hi> (no matter though there be not one grain of reality among them all,) and if theſe Counterfits can but work ſo powerful an Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on their Miſtriſſes ſoft good nature, as to make them receive the conſtant repeated Oaths of their highly adoring them, with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38135:46"/>ſome kind of delight; they are then in a ſad yielding condition; for ſuch Womens hearts cannot pretend to be ſtronger than fortified Towns, which when they once come to admit of frequent parlies, ſeldom hold out after long Sieges, but yeild to a Surrender.</p>
               <p>Certainly if young Gallants can by their eager courting their Miſtriſſes, but gain of them ſome returns of compaſſion and eſteem, next of courſe follows a favourable liking of them, and then there's no very great difficulty, after ſuch proſperous advances, to create in them the beginnings of a Love fondneſs; and fondneſs in a <hi>young Womans heart, like a weighty body</hi> down a ſteep <hi>Hill,</hi> it ſeldom ſtops till it runs to the <hi>very bottom;</hi> and when <hi>a Gallant</hi> has work'd his <hi>Miſtris</hi> into ſuch a yielding temper, as to credit his <hi>Oaths,</hi> and be pleas'd with his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> as believing he truly loves her, and highly admires her, and ſo <hi>grows delighted</hi> with the <hi>Repetition</hi> of them, eſteeming all his Courtſhip real, then ſurely they cannot on the account of good Nature, and pure Civility, <hi>forbear</hi> preſenting their <hi>Gallants,</hi> though <hi>to their own</hi> ruin, <hi>this</hi> new <hi>Article</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> that they believe their <hi>Oathes,</hi> and love their <hi>Perſons,</hi> and when once they declare that, common experience may ſoon teach them this, that 'tis no great rarity in <hi>young Maids</hi> by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>young Men,</hi> to ſtray into vicious <hi>act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> with them; and thus by theſe <hi>kinds</hi> of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38135:46"/>degrees and ſteps, <hi>Gallants</hi> commonly mount to their <hi>Miſtriſſes</hi> ruin; for as the <hi>Poet</hi> ſays, <hi>Long waiting Love doth ſtill a paſſage find,</hi> to the moſt unbelieving <hi>mind, at</hi> leaſt to the blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Reputation, if not the utter undoing of her vertue, fortune, and freedom; for when once a <hi>Gallant</hi> is become <hi>Maſter</hi> of his <hi>Miſtriſſes</hi> heart, he commonly ſwells to a <hi>Monſter,</hi> and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns like a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and inſtead of <hi>treating</hi> you like an ador'd <hi>Miſtris,</hi> he uſes you like a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd <hi>Captive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I have told the <hi>young Ladies</hi> ſome of the <hi>common</hi> ways their <hi>Gallants</hi> uſe to gain them by, give me leave here in a word or two, to tell you their uſual manner of treating them, after they have gain'd an entire Conqueſt over their hearts, which is very bad, and ſinful in then to ſuffer. Therefore, let me adviſe you to carry ſtill this <hi>Memorandum</hi> about you, That all your <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants dying expreſſions, Love-Oaths, Idolizing poſtures,</hi> and often repeated <hi>Vows,</hi> that their admiration, and love for you, ſhall be as laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as their Lives, which tranſlated out of the Lovers <hi>Language</hi> into true plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> is no more but juſt as long as they ſhall fancy your Beauty; for uſually as faſt as their <hi>Miſtriſſes beauty</hi> breaks, ſo do their <hi>Oaths</hi> of Love and Conſtancy, which they think they are bound to keep no longer, than their <hi>Miſtriſſes</hi> keep their <hi>beauty,</hi> as being but the meer <hi>effects</hi> of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38135:47"/>that cauſe, and the <hi>cauſe</hi> being <hi>remou'd, the effect muſt of courſe ceaſe,</hi> and beſides there's nothing more certain than that <hi>skin deep</hi> beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſeldom creates better than meer <hi>ſenſual love,</hi> which never contains reality, or long <hi>duration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Ladies</hi> if this were all it would not be ſo very bad, or indeed this is only the leaſt part of it, and when your <hi>Gallant</hi> has enjoy'd you, methinks you ought not to wonder that he honours you no longer as his <hi>Miſtris,</hi> when you diſhonour your ſelf by becoming his <hi>Miſs;</hi> for fancy what you pleaſe, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd <hi>Miſtris</hi> is no better, let her Quality be never ſo good, and her beauty never ſo great, and there's no Woman ought to think it ſtrange, that her <hi>Gallant</hi> after enjoyment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalues her, when by it, ſhe ſhews him the way, by fiirſt undervaluing her ſelf, and ſo ought to expect little Love, and leſs Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but rather much ſlighting, if not aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for this is moſt certain, <hi>Ladies,</hi> that though your <hi>Gallants</hi> uſe all flattering means and arts, not ſparing their <hi>Oaths</hi> or <hi>Money, Soul</hi> or <hi>Purſe,</hi> to purchaſe your good Nature, (I ſhould have ſaid ſinful folly,) to bleſs them, as they call it, with the enjoyment of you, (that is, to curſe your ſelves by <hi>admitting</hi> it,) which when your <hi>Gallants</hi> have obtain'd on any terms, <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>forſwearing</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted they preſently like greedy <hi>Hawks,</hi> who
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38135:47"/>aſſoon as they have fully <hi>gorg'd</hi> themſelves on their <hi>Quarry,</hi> ſlight and turn <hi>Tail</hi> to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame Game, which juſt before they flew ſo eagerly after, and grow ſoon as weary of an enjoy'd <hi>Miſtris,</hi> as moſt <hi>eldeſt Sons</hi> are of their long <hi>long liv'd Fathers,</hi> or their ugly <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Wives;</hi> in a word, our <hi>Amorous Age</hi> is ſo very wicked and unchaſt, that really moſt of our young Mens <hi>fiery Love</hi> to the thing call'd a <hi>Miſtris,</hi> is by our preſent <hi>mode</hi> become of the ſame nature of <hi>Fire</hi> it ſelf, which all know can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt long if not often recruited with freſh matter.</p>
               <p>And I have yet, <hi>Ladies,</hi> ſomething more to add, which is of a much worſe conſequence than all before, which is this, that after your <hi>Gallants</hi> have enjoy'd you, though never ſo much in private, they will not be ſatisfied unleſs they may boaſt of it in <hi>Publick,</hi> ſo vain are our young <hi>Sparks,</hi> as to take more ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the thoughts that others believe they enjoy their <hi>Miſtriſſes,</hi> than they themſelves do in the actual enjoyment of them; our young Men retaining ſtill ſo much of the old <hi>Roman</hi> pride, as to love the <hi>Triumph</hi> more than the <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> and indeed I am of opinion, that on the bragging account of enjoying <hi>Miſtriſſes</hi> now ſo much in faſhion among the late <hi>Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees;</hi> thoſe Men that boaſt they do, though they do it not, are not ſo bad, as thoſe that boaſt of it in ſo vain-glorious a manner as to act a real Sin.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:38135:48"/>
               <p>Then the young <hi>Gallant</hi> can tell their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd <hi>Miſtriſſes,</hi> that meer love of beauty is but a meer amorous deſire, and that none but <hi>fools</hi> deſire what they poſſeſs, poſſeſſion being the full end and accompliſhment of all deſire, and conſequently of all beauty Love, and ſo laugh at the ſimplicity of thoſe that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure long the ſcorching flames of a violent Love paſſion, fancying none but the fooliſh barbarous <hi>Perſians</hi> can long adore that Sun which burns them.</p>
               <p>And our young <hi>Gallants</hi> are now generally grown ſo very nice, that they cannot feed on any thing, but ſweet <hi>variety,</hi> which makes them rant in the <hi>Hectoring Language</hi> of the <hi>Times,</hi> and ſay that 'tis as <hi>unmodiſh</hi> to have but one <hi>Miſtris,</hi> as to have none at all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Swear that <hi>Miſtriſſes</hi> enjoy'd though never ſo young and beautiful, are but like <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances</hi> read, and <hi>Plays</hi> once ſeen; and indeed methinks enjoy'd <hi>Miſtriſſes,</hi> ought not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at their <hi>Gallants</hi> ſickleneſs, it being not at all ſtrange that an unvertuous <hi>Love</hi> ſhould make an inconſtant <hi>Lover.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I muſt beg leave to glance my diſcourſe a little on a Fault, which ſome young <hi>Ladies</hi> commit, without ever conſidering 'tis one, which is ſometimes to exerciſe their wit, ſhew their pride, and vanity, or gaity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, or what elſe you pleaſe to call it, to make themſelves ſport and entertainment, ſpread
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38135:48"/>abroad their fine <hi>ſilken nets</hi> of inticing arts, and attracting allurements, to incourage and invite ſome <hi>young Fop,</hi> to become fond of one of their Company, as his dearly <hi>beloved,</hi> and highly admir'd <hi>Miſtris,</hi> only that they may have thereby, the better means and occaſion to rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and make paſtime with him, never conſidering that by making him thus to fall in love with one of them, he is obliged by the general Rules, and <hi>common practices</hi> of our <hi>Modern refin'd Lovers,</hi> to magnify and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll her beauty; and never to be ſparing of his Oaths and Lies, in praiſing her perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and his own overflowing paſſion and ſo cauſe him to ſin in earneſt, though probably deſign'd by the <hi>Lady</hi> as a Jeſt; but 'twill be no ſufficient excuſe in this bad kind of raillery, to ſay your intention was innocent, ſince its effect is culpable, <hi>for we are not to do ill, that good may come of it;</hi> and ſure <hi>much leſs to do ill, where no good can come of it,</hi> and I am ſure this is an undeniable truth, That ſhe who makes another do an ill thing, does an ill thing her ſelf, by her making another to do it.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Ladies,</hi> whether in Jeſt or Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, if you are truly <hi>vertuous,</hi> and deſire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to continue ſo, and that the world ſhould eſteem you ſuch, as deſigning to admit men only to admire your Perſons but never to ruin your vertue; the beſt way to effect it is never to let them Court your <hi>beauty;</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38135:49"/>that the <hi>Fire</hi> of Love is like that of <hi>Anger, a ſhort, but fierce madneſs;</hi> for a Man that's in Love, during the raging <hi>fit</hi> of his enflam'd luſtful paſſion, talks light and idly, for a Lovers heart riſes and falls, is happy and unhappy, according as his <hi>Miſtris</hi> is kind or unkind, it being indeed but very ſuitable to the folly of being in Love, that ſuch a <hi>Lovers</hi> heart, ſhould never move according to the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates</hi> of his own reaſon, but the vain motions of his <hi>Miſtriſſes</hi> fickle fancy; and therefore becauſe ſuch <hi>Men</hi> know not what the do, their <hi>Miſtriſſes</hi> ought not to mind what they ſay, nor admit their Addreſſes, though they pretend them in <hi>jest,</hi> or for meer paſtime, and not to kindle their hopes, when they mean never to feed their deſires, but avoid converſing with them, and entertaining of them; for ſurely all perſons ought to avoid mad Bedlam acquaintances, and young Men <hi>during</hi> their diſtracted <hi>Love paſſion,</hi> value not what Praiſes they preſent, what Offers they make, nor indeed what price they give, to purchaſe the enjoyment of their dear <hi>Miſtriſſes,</hi> though it be at the damnable rate of long continued <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and often repeated <hi>Perjury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O ſtrange and wicked madneſs, that theſe kind of Lovers cannot be content to give their <hi>Miſtriſſes</hi> their heart for a little time, without giving their Souls to the <hi>Devil</hi> for ever, and fancy he is as very obliging as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38135:49"/>they are fooliſh, and inconſtant, and that the <hi>Devil</hi> will as eaſily forget the <hi>Oaths</hi> they made to him, as they do theirs they made to their <hi>Miſtriſſes,</hi> which <hi>were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended but as meer Courtiers Complements,</hi> which are meant no longer than they are ſpeaking, and therefore ought to be thought on no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than they are hearing; but though ſuch Lovers fancy they give their Souls to the <hi>Devil</hi> but in <hi>jeſt,</hi> yet he will be careful to keep them in <hi>earneſt,</hi> for if they will commit the ſin of making ſuch <hi>Oaths,</hi> let them have a care the <hi>Devil</hi> be not permitted to make them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Helliſh <hi>Penance</hi> of keeping them, God will not be mocked.</p>
               <p>I have enlarged this Diſcourſe on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Mens overpraiſing and Courting Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with great Confidence, becauſe I fancy with much <hi>Experience,</hi> though I am ſure with little <hi>Prudence,</hi> for I <hi>confeſs</hi> ſuch <hi>experience</hi> was bought too dear, yet I have this ſatisfaction, that the fault of committing a vice, do's not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the confeſſion of it, but in the yeilding to it, and therefore I own I have ſerved much more than a thrice ſeven years <hi>Prenticeſhip</hi> in the <hi>Trade</hi> of Love, and its fooliſh appendant <hi>Train</hi> of Fopperies, which was <hi>(I confeſs)</hi> a great fault againſt the well ſpending of my time, which might have been much better employ'd in the duties of <hi>Religion,</hi> than in the paſtimes and vain company of modiſh <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:38135:50"/>but I have now ſerv'd out my Time, in that fooliſh <hi>Trade,</hi> and am become a perfect <hi>freeman,</hi> as to that folly of Courting all modiſh Ladies; not that I am at all grown a <hi>Woman ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or a preciſe <hi>Puritan,</hi> or ſuch a true Diſciple of <hi>Job, as to make a Covenant with mine Eyes,</hi> not to behold a handſom Woman, for I ſhall ſtill own, <hi>I look upon all beautiful Women,</hi> to come neareſt of all Creatures in <hi>brightneſs</hi> and <hi>ſplendor</hi> to the <hi>glorious Angels,</hi> and am very much pleaſed, when I can paſs away an hour or two in an afternoon, among ſuch of them as are not irreligious, but of a vertuous reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are good Wits, free humor'd, and of pleaſant Converſe, for 'tis not keeping com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with, but paying an <hi>adoration</hi> to, Ladies <hi>beauty,</hi> that makes the crime ſinful; as 'tis not making <hi>Images</hi> to adorn <hi>Churches,</hi> but building <hi>Churches</hi> to worſhip <hi>Images,</hi> that makes the <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

               <p>And ſince <hi>Recreation</hi> for the mind is as well neceſſary as <hi>Exerciſe</hi> for the body, I ſee no reaſon why it may not be lawful for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create my ſelf, now and then in an afternoon, in ſuch good young Womens company and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, to hear their opinions, and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, (which the rude ſort of Men call <hi>Twat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi>) on the <hi>Stories</hi> of the place, and their ſeveral fancies and judgments on the divers <hi>Faſhions</hi> then worn; who are the Women moſt talk'd of, for whom, and what <hi>beauties</hi> are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38135:50"/>cried up, and which of them loves moſt, and carries on an <hi>Intrigue</hi> beſt, lives higheſt, wears the <hi>richeſt Clothes,</hi> keeps the <hi>fineſt Equipage,</hi> and has moſt Gallants, and this Gentlewoman is to be Married to that Gentleman, who in a little time will find her <hi>Debts</hi> much greater than her <hi>Beauty</hi> or <hi>Portion</hi> either, and ſuch a pretty <hi>Maid</hi> is to be Married by a <hi>Match</hi> of her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents making to ſuch a one, in whom ſhe will be very unhappy, her heart being prepoſſeſſed by another, and ſuch an old <hi>Man</hi> is jealous of his <hi>young Wife</hi> without a Cauſe, and ſuch a <hi>young Man</hi> is not jealous of his handſom Wife with one, and the like <hi>Subjects,</hi> which I grant in ſevere ſtrictneſs, may be truly call'd an omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in not ſpending our time ſo well as we ought, which I look upon to be more a <hi>venial vice,</hi> than an <hi>unpardonable ſin,</hi> and therefore do not believe that the knowledge of my <hi>infirmity,</hi> ought to be the <hi>deſpair</hi> of my <hi>Recovery;</hi> but I am truly pleas'd that all unlawful deſigns, and unchaſt deſires as to Women, are baniſhed from my heart, and that <hi>Vertue</hi> has made me quite leave them, before <hi>Age</hi> has made them quite leave me.</p>
               <p>But 'tis more than time to finiſh this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, for I have dwelt longer on it than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but the trouble of it, I hope the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> will the more eaſily pardon, ſince 'tis not only a fault, but a habit, that I have been much ſubject to, and long infected with,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38135:51"/>which is to be loth to part with <hi>young Womens</hi> Company, when I am once got into it, and therefore I will conclude this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> with this Complement to the Ladies, that I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh it may prove as ſatisfactory and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to them, as to make them all now as fond of <hi>piety,</hi> as I was once of <hi>beauty,</hi> and that they may continue to love it, as many years as I did them, and then I dare aſſure them this double bleſſing, That they ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther live ill, nor die young.</p>

                  <hi>THE FOURTH DISCOURSE,</hi> Of the extraordinary governing Power that Womens Beauty now exerciſes over moſt Men.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>BLeſs me and deliver me!</hi> What a ſtrange Subject do I now fall on, and into what a vaſt <hi>Sea</hi> am I now <hi>Imbarking!</hi> The <hi>Bay of Biskay</hi> with all its proud ſwelling waves, is but as a calm pond to it; for that only toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Ships into the Air, and preſently brings them down again; but this Subject elevates my Pen above the <hi>Skie,</hi> and there leaves it; for Womens governing <hi>Power,</hi> has no certain Top nor Bottom, but <hi>Circle-like,</hi> is without beginning or end: How can it poſſibly be then deſcrib'd, it being a meer <hi>Maze</hi> of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of Confuſions, in which it has made ſo many croſs Paths of pride and folly, vanity and power, as I know not which to take, or which to leave, where to advance, or how to retreat: And yet I find in my ſelf an
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38135:52"/>earneſt inclination to venture on it, though I am ſure to be loſt in it; for I muſt expect that this dull and ſhort <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> on the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous Subject of beauties mighty <hi>power,</hi> can have no other fate than that of <hi>Rivers,</hi> which ſtill run with an eager, haſte, though it be only to plunge themſelves into the <hi>Sea,</hi> in which they are preſently loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Story</hi> tells us of ſome <hi>Engliſh Frigats</hi> that ſail'd up to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and were there ſo generally admir'd, that the great <hi>Turk</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf went to ſee them, and was very much taken with their beauty, ſhape and ſtrength; and being told there were hundreds finer in <hi>England,</hi> he commanded that the <hi>Map</hi> of the World ſhould be preſently brought him, that he might ſee that brave <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> which produced ſuch gallant effects; the <hi>Map</hi> being come, he laid his finger careleſly on it, and ask'd whereabouts <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was, but the perſon that was to ſhew it him, told him he could not do it, till he took off his finger, for it quite cover'd that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Thus one Inch of the Worlds Map ſerves to ſet out all <hi>Englands Confines,</hi> but a hundred ſheets of Paper cannot half deſcribe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary bounds of <hi>Womens</hi> uſurping <hi>power:</hi> If I look up towards the height of it, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at the ſight of ſo bright and clear a <hi>Scene</hi> of meer ſanciful <hi>Splendor,</hi> and if I look
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38135:52"/>downwards on it, I meet in my <hi>Compaſs,</hi> crowds of Adorers and Suitors thick proſtrate at their feet, ſome courting their great <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> others admiring their high <hi>power,</hi> ſome begging their <hi>favour,</hi> but moſt bribing their <hi>intereſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though their beauty cannot at all <hi>dazle</hi> my ſight, yet this Subject do's indeed <hi>puzzle</hi> my Pen, for really I am ſo far from knowing how to end this Diſcourſe, as I profeſs I know not yet where to begin it, and indeed when I have writ all I can on it, I fancy I can make no other than this <hi>whole ſale judgment</hi> of it, That beauties univerſal <hi>governing Power</hi> is of a <hi>miraculous nature</hi> like that of the <hi>Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea,</hi> every body may daily ſee its ſtrange effects, but none can give a good reaſon for the true cauſe; therefore I am ſure my weakneſs ought not to attempt, what the ſtrength of wit, and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> could never perform.</p>
               <p>So that I am reſolv'd to venture on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but as little <hi>Boys</hi> do on a great <hi>River,</hi> not hazard far on it, for fear of being loſt in it, but content themſelves with wading a little on the Brink of it, and there to dable and waſh them, out of the reach of its great depth, and fierce ſtream.</p>
               <p>And though I know that the cauſe of Mens ſo enſlaving themſelves to handſom Womens <hi>power</hi> cannot ſpring but from a mean ſlaviſh
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38135:53"/>nature, and ſo ought not to be look'd upon better by any conſidering Men, than a kind of Kingdom in the <hi>Moon</hi> or <hi>Fairy Land,</hi> only hatch'd by the fiery amorous Love, of a high, luſtful, and enflam'd diſtemper'd paſſion; ſeated in the vain <hi>Aiery Region,</hi> of meer fooliſh imagination, being not grounded on any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of true reaſon or good conſideration.</p>
               <p>Yet I cannot imitate the <hi>Map makers,</hi> who ſtill leave a blank for their <hi>Terra Incognita,</hi> but I muſt fill up my Paper, and rather than not write more of it, I will leave of ſcratching my head, and breaking my brain any longer about it, to find out how, and where to begin this deſperate Subject, it being like a <hi>Coal</hi> all over red hot, there's no touching it in any part, without <hi>burning</hi> one finger, 'tis like a <hi>Hedge-Hogg</hi> all over prickles, ſo that 'twill be almoſt as hard a task for me to know how to hit upon a ſafe good way to begin this Diſcourſe, as to find a ſure means to put an end to Womens governing power. But ſince I muſt begin, I will as all <hi>Builders</hi> do, never mind to have the firſt foundation ſtone cut into any ſhape; ſo I am reſolv'd to lay my firſt entrance into this Diſcourſe, on the Courtſhips, and power of the <hi>Welch</hi> Ladies, for there I fancy the Men take no pains, nor uſe any arts to ſquare or poliſh their Addreſſes; but only take what comes uppermoſt, as they ariſe out of pure Natures Quarry.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:38135:53"/>
               <p>And truly I am of opinion that according to the Rules of ſober reaſon, and naked truth, the <hi>Welch</hi> ought to be eſteem'd the more for it, ſince as 'tis a general approv'd Rule, that of evils we ought ſtill to chooſe the leaſt; ſo ſure by the ſame rule of proportion, we ought of troubles to chooſe the ſhorteſt, which being granted, we muſt neceſſarily come to own, that the <hi>Welch</hi> Courtſhip, and manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Love, muſt needs ſurpaſs our great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of that Trade the <hi>French;</hi> for the <hi>Welch</hi> are all plain honeſt dealing Men, and good kind friends, who are well acquainted with one anothers humors; and therefore eſteem it ſuperfluous to make many words to a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which makes them railly both the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> who they ſay dare not approach their <hi>Miſtriſſes</hi> but with humble looks, and obedient poſtures, ſpeaking as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.13. <hi>With their feet, by making ſo many Legs before they come to them,</hi> and thoſe with as much exactneſs, as <hi>Poets</hi> make Verſes, where every ſyllable muſt be weigh'd, that they may keep juſt Meaſures, and true <hi>Cadence,</hi> as well in their approaches as addreſſes: Nor dare they ſpeak to them but with large Harangues of Praiſes, ſtill beſieging their Miſtriſſes with Armies of Complements, in admiration of their beauty and perfections, and moſt of theſe fierce great Lovers, (I had almoſt ſaid worſe) differ and excel one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38135:54"/>in their manner of Addreſſes, means of Approaches, expences in Preſents, degrees of Courtſhip, and ways of Treating and the like; whereas the plain dealing honeſt <hi>Welch-men,</hi> are moſt of an equal kind of breeding and birth, being all Gentlemen of <hi>Wales,</hi> and moſt of them <hi>high born,</hi> which is a truth, all that have Travell'd thorow their Country will eaſily believe, ſince really in one ſenſe, few of them can be other, conſidering the many elevated <hi>Mountains</hi> their Country is made up with, and yet I often obſerv'd in my Travelling through it, that the Men of that Country, are generally of a very plain breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and much of a level <hi>Capacity,</hi> for though <hi>Wales</hi> is highly ſeated, yet 'tis but of a ſhort extent, which occaſions the whole <hi>Country</hi> to lie under the ſame degree of <hi>Elevation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Welch Gentry</hi> have for the moſt part an averſion to the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrin, ſo they have no fancy for <hi>Romance</hi> Courtſhip, few ſtudying the one, and fewer practiſing the other, and yet for all they are both great <hi>Vertuoſos,</hi> and expert Soldiers in the Art of expeditiouſly managing a <hi>Venus War,</hi> and can ſooner take by ſtorm the <hi>Fort</hi> of their <hi>Welch Miſtriſſes</hi> heart, than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>French</hi> can finiſh their Approaches to gain ſo much as the outworks of their <hi>Miſtriſſes</hi> civil and favourable Looks.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:38135:54"/>
               <p>But I am ſtray'd from my <hi>Theme,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I'll conclude my <hi>Welch Travels,</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terloping Diſcourſes of <hi>Wales,</hi> leaving the <hi>Welch Cavaliers</hi> to the power of their own Country <hi>Miſtriſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And take notice how we are now in <hi>England</hi> ſhrunk into ſuch a <hi>Brood</hi> of <hi>unmaſculine Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat</hi> Men that are ſuch adorers of their Miſtriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes beauty, as they cannot behold them but through the magnifying <hi>Proſpective</hi> of their own enflam'd luſtful paſſion, and amorous folly, which renders their <hi>Miſtriſſes</hi> beauty ſo large and Charming, and their <hi>Power</hi> ſo high and Mighty, that like the <hi>poſſeſſed man in the Goſpel,</hi> they will run thorow fire and water, in their <hi>Love fit,</hi> and to feed their momentary flames, will venture thoſe of everlaſting Burning.</p>
               <p>This wretched ſort of <hi>Slaves</hi> to Womens <hi>Power,</hi> who in their Courtſhip and Addreſſes to gain their <hi>Miſtriſſes</hi> hearts, do ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly hazard the loſs of their own Souls, by offending God in their words and actions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble exactly thoſe People of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> which the <hi>Prophet Iſaiah</hi> cap. 3. v. 8. ſpeaks of, <hi>They are fallen down becauſe their Tongue and doings are againſt the Lord, provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eyes of his Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the <hi>Prophet</hi> has told you their fault, he will alſo tell you their puniſhment, <hi>The Lord of Hoſt will take from them the Judg and the Prophet, the Prudent and the Ancient,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38135:55"/>and will give Children to be their Princes, and Babes to be their Governors;</hi> and pray what is the conſequence of this noble <hi>Infant Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> why the <hi>Prophet</hi> tells you, Verſ. 5. <hi>And the People ſhall be oppreſſed one by another, every one by his Neigbour, the Child ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf proudly againſt the Ancient, and the baſe againſt the honourable,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And as 'tis a practical Art in <hi>Oratory</hi> to keep the beſt Arguments to bring up the Rear of the Diſcourſe to leave the ſtrongeſt Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the laſt, ſo God is pleaſed to reſerve for the laſt, the greateſt puniſhment of all, which he here threatens by the Prophet when he tells men, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. <hi>And Women ſhall rule over them.</hi> Really 'tis a ſign the Peoples ſtay and ſtrength are gone, and their prudence out of Power, when Women are placed to Rule over them, from whence without the help of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi> I can eaſily extract this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> That the <hi>Almighty</hi> who ſure beſt knows the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of his own Creatures, places Women in the ſame Rank with <hi>Children,</hi> thereby plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denoting, That a <hi>Nurſery</hi> kind of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> ſuits beſt with Womens <hi>Power;</hi> and this kind of doctrin is in ſome manner confirmed by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> though in a larger Character, for he aſcribes to Women as their fit ſphere, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per imployment the <hi>guiding of the houſe,</hi> that is, the Women in it.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:38135:55"/>
               <p>There is an <hi>Author who in his diſcourſe of Women very well obſerves, that they have but three States of Life, Virginity, Marriage, and Widdowhood; for the firſt two they are, or ought to be, ſtates of ſubjection to Parents, and Husbands; and for that of Widdowhood, God himſelf counts that ſtate of life to be deſolate and ſad, the Almighty having deſign'd them for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and therefore accounts Women moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, when moſt at liberty from Mans Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now ſurely out of theſe reaſons and conſiderations of his, I may here ſafely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe truly, draw this undeniable Argument and concluſion.</p>
               <p>That it cannot but be very bad for Men to be under Womens Government, when God ſays 'tis very ſad for Women to be under their own.</p>
               <p>And ſo I have done with the time, when 'twas appointed for Women to govern over Men; next of courſe follows the manner how they Ruled, and that we have an account of in few words, in the 12 <hi>verſe</hi> of that <hi>Chapter</hi> aforementioned by the Prophet, <hi>O my people ſays the Lord,</hi> Thoſe, <hi>(that is the Women) that lead ye, cauſe you to err, and deſtroy the ways of thy Paths:</hi> Thus we find that error and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, are the effects of Womens ruling power, it being contrary to the ways of Truth, (for it cauſeth Error,) and the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of Reaſon, I cannot ſay of common
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38135:56"/>Practice; and it was here appointed to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, not as a favour, but for a puniſhment, as an effect of Gods wrath againſt his People, it being a Reverſe of the Fundamental Law which was made by God almoſt as ſoon as the World, I am ſure as early as the firſt Man in it; for Sacred writ tells, that 'twas laid as a load on the firſt Woman for her diſobedience to her Maker, that ſhe ſhould be ſubject to her Husband, and though to be ſo now, is but the practice of very few Wives of our Age, yet that do's not hinder it from being the duty of all from the beginning of the World.</p>
               <p>Therefore let all our high <hi>ſpirited govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Women,</hi> who make their ſilly Husbands, and fooliſh Gallants, ſuch ſlaves to their <hi>Power,</hi> becauſe admirers of their beauty, remember what one very well obſerv'd, <hi>That the day of the date of Womens Power over Man, was the day of the date of her ſin againſt God:</hi> It being moſt clear and plain, that from <hi>Adams</hi> time, the Woman ought to be in ſubjection to the Man, and therefore <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will not have the Woman uſurp an authority over the Man,</hi> and ſeems <hi>to give the Reaſon, for firſt</hi> Adam <hi>was made, then</hi> Eve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> well obſerves in ſaying, <hi>There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of meanneſs in the moſt ſeeming gallant and inviting ſin; I am ſure</hi> there is a great <hi>meaneſs of Spirit</hi> in Mens ſo ſubjecting themſelves to Womens <hi>power,</hi> ſince ſuch muſt in effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38135:56"/>that they have loſt not only the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of Men, but the very Nature of <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> what did I ſay, they have loſt the Nature of Gentlemen, nay I might have added, <hi>the very natural right and reaſon of humanity,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to looſe the great honour of being <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Men, for ſuch Petty-Coat Men ought to be Tranſplanted into the Suburbs of <hi>England, Wales,</hi> where the Language of that Country fits exactly their effeminate humor, who by a kind of <hi>Welch Paradox,</hi> call the Man, <hi>hur,</hi> not he, and indeed <hi>hur,</hi> ſuits betten than <hi>he,</hi> with ſuch a ſort of <hi>female Gentry,</hi> who are compoſed of ſuch <hi>unmaſculine Spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Really when I reflect on what Crowds there are of this pitiful rank of Men, who take ſo great pride and delight, in being conſtant adorers, and humble ſervants to their Miſtriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes beauty, not in railery, but in reality, who are as very happy in their own conceit, if their Miſtriſſes do oblige them with a kind word, or favourable look, as if the <hi>Day Star</hi> from above had come to viſit them, and to lead them into eternal light, and that all the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of the Stars</hi> had combin'd together, to be <hi>propitious</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>Yet after all 'tis a very great pity, that theſe ſort of Miſtriſſes, do not beſtow on theſe kind of ſervants Lace to their Coats, for ſure they are fools enough to deſerve it, and I ſee no reaſon why ſuch who are ſo ambitious of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38135:57"/>their ſervice, ſhould refuſe to wear their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, and be out of Countenance to be known Fools by their Coats, when they are not aſham'd to deſerve that name by their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays <hi>a ſlothful Man ſhall be covered with rags;</hi> and ſo indeed ought ſuch Men, who are dull and drowſie in the exerciſe of their own power, and over-active in their obedience to Womens, for which they well deſerve to wear the <hi>Colours</hi> of their Miſtriſſes Soveraignity, and their ſlavery, on the ragg'd <hi>Fools Coat</hi> of their own ſimplicity.</p>
               <p>Sure all ſuch Men as will debaſe themſelves into ſuch an effeminate ſervitude, as to render it both eaſie and habitual to them, cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in the leaſt to poſſeſs a noble or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirit, for that muſt be averſe to it, ſince it makes a Man not ony unfit to ſerve his <hi>King and Country,</hi> (the duty of every good Subject,) but even to be uſeful to himſelf, and family. Whereas if young Men ſtudied <hi>noble Sciences,</hi> inſtead of courting <hi>handſom Women,</hi> who can only divert their Time, probably corrupt their Lives, whereas the practice of vertue, and the ſtudy of Men and buſineſs, with other uſeful Sciences, will refine and ſtrengthen their knowledge, fortifie prudence in their actions, kindle Magnanimity in their hearts, raiſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deſires in their minds, and ſo poliſh and regulate all the weighty actions of their lives,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38135:57"/>ſo as to render them fit to ſerve their Country, both in War and Peace, and themſelves and families to boot, which advantage can never redound on either, by courting and ſerving beauty never ſo long, for meer beauty ſake: And I wonder your beauty <hi>Courtiers</hi> do not obſerve, that great beauties ſeldom eſteem, the long attendance, or great ſervices of their <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> as they ought, becauſe they value more their own beauty than they ſhould, which makes it common for ſuch Women to ruin their Lovers liberty, to proclaim their own Soveraignty over it, and therefore ſure it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not appear very unreaſonable, that ſuch Men as will make themſelves Slaves to Womens beauty, ſhould paſs for fools in ſober Mens thoughts.</p>
               <p>Indeed there's one Law (and but one Law I know) which though a <hi>French</hi> one, yet as great lovers as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies are of the <hi>French</hi> faſhions; they are ſo far from eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or allowing it, as they will not endure ſo much as to hear it nam'd, and that's called the <hi>Salick Law,</hi> which in <hi>France</hi> prohibits the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Sex from wearing the Breeches, and Reigning, which our high ſpirited governing Women in <hi>England,</hi> ſo hate the Name of, as there was a report, they were about calling a Parliament of Women, to vote it high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, againſt the Power of their preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to but name bringing that Law into
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38135:58"/>

               <p>But truly in <hi>my opinion,</hi> at the high rate of power Womens <hi>beauty</hi> now Governs, the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> have no cauſe to be concern'd, that the <hi>Breeches</hi> are not given to them by <hi>Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſince it is freely beſtowed on them by <hi>the Cuſtom of the Country,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom you know makes Laws,</hi> and thoſe as binding as any ſhe <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſince they are ratified and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Major part</hi> of the <hi>Lords Spiritual and Temporal, as well as the Knights Burgeſſes, and Commons,</hi> who by many Signs and Tokens give great cauſe of fear, that they have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, in a perfect obedience to beauties So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power and Wives Government over their Husbands.</p>
               <p>Indeed for the <hi>Proteſtant Clergy,</hi> they muſt be concern'd parties and fellow ſufferers, in the general Calamity of having <hi>Governing Wives:</hi> but for the <hi>Roman Clergy,</hi> they are quite free from that miſery and ſervitude, becauſe they muſt never Marry, ſo that they can be no concern'd parties, as to their own Wives, and therefore may be aiding and aſſiſting in promoting, and confirming Wives in their Univerſal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38135:58"/>over their poor Husbands, which they are briskly ſayling towards with a too proſperous Gail. But I hope the <hi>Fates</hi> will protect poor Husbands, from ſuch an unnatural, ſhameful, and <hi>Tyrannical</hi> kind of <hi>Government;</hi> for if ever all Wives ſhould attain to that <hi>Supremacy</hi> of Power, (which but too many have already,) Wives would then make ſuch a total deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Husbands authority over them, as the Wives <hi>Monarchy</hi> would be then as abſolute in <hi>England,</hi> as that of the <hi>French King</hi> is now in <hi>France,</hi> and would make then their <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands</hi> as great Fools, as that <hi>King</hi> do's now his <hi>ordinary Subjects Slaves:</hi> In ſhort I really fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Engliſh Wives</hi> would be then as very reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in maintaining their new <hi>Franchiſes</hi> over all their <hi>Husbands</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> is now ſteady in deſtroying the <hi>old Franchiſes</hi> of all <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then we muſt conclude, that <hi>Diogenes</hi> his <hi>Prophecy</hi> is fullfill'd, who order'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be buried with his Face downward, <hi>ſaying, The World will turn upſide down,</hi> and then he ſhall <hi>lie</hi> in his right place. Then we ſhall reckon as the old <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> did, by Nights, not Days: Then we ſhall look on all Government, as we read <hi>Hebrew,</hi> that's backward. Then that Verſe ſhall be razed out of the Bible, that ſays the <hi>Woman is the weaker Veſſel:</hi> Nor ſhall S. <hi>Pauls</hi> inſtruction to <hi>Titus</hi> when he left him in <hi>Crete,</hi> paſs for good
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38135:59"/>practical Doctrin, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 12. <hi>That young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are to be ſober, diſcreet, and obedient to their Husbands,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> thereby plainly implying, That a <hi>Wives obedience,</hi> is a <hi>Wives diſcretion,</hi> Then ſhall the <hi>old Men ſee Viſions, and the young Men,</hi> (eſpecially the married) <hi>dream Dreams.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I would gladly hear what ſort of anſwer and interpretation, the <hi>Governing-ſpirit Ladies</hi> will make to the Queſtion of our <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour,</hi> Can the Servant be greater than his Lord? For ſurely Wives aſſuming <hi>power,</hi> cannot render them ſo over ſenſeleſs, as to fancy he ask'd it as a Queſtion of doubt, but ſpoke it as a thing of impoſſibility, that a Servant can be greater than his Lord, any more than a Son elder than his Father.</p>
               <p>And now Women are about impoſſibilities, and vain dreams, methinks they ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour getting the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone,</hi> for that would be very convenient to carry about in their <hi>Breeches Pockets,</hi> ſo that as they have now got the powerful <hi>knack,</hi> to change Men into Women, and their poor Husbands <hi>Rentals</hi> into <hi>Shop-books,</hi> ſo they may then by the vertue of the ſame Elixir, and the more powerful Charms of their own killing <hi>beauty,</hi> turn all Metal into <hi>Gold,</hi> as well as too many Wives now a days turn their <hi>ſilly Husbands Lands and Woods</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rich <hi>Gownes,</hi> and <hi>fine Coaches.</hi> 'Twas the ſaying of a <hi>great Roman;</hi> (who I fancy Married
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38135:59"/>a kind of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> humor'd Wife) that the Womens <hi>rich Gowns</hi> deſtroy'd more <hi>Men,</hi> than all the <hi>Enemies Arrows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now Reader, I am ſure you muſt be tir'd as well as I am of this Subject of Womens Power, tho many Men are not of their ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to it, and therefore I will now take leave of theſe great beauty adorers, for I cannot as they do, Dream with my Eyes open, nor can I ſpare them ſo much of my patience, as to wait for the <hi>Chimera iſſues</hi> of their Dreams, my deſign being only to write of, not to dwell on this Subject, and perhaps I have already not only writ more on it than I ſhould, but ſharper of it than I ought; for conſidering how ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, as well as powerfully Women now wear the <hi>Breeches,</hi> 'tis dangerous provoking them, eſpecially having now in my mind the ſaying of <hi>a great Philoſopher, Thoſe that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der little</hi> (as moſt <hi>Women do</hi>) <hi>are apt to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſoon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſure if <hi>wiſe Solomon</hi> in his days, when certainly the Women did not then pretend to half the power they now uſurp, could prefer dwelling in a Wilderneſs, before living with an angry Woman, how cautious, nay fearful ought the writers of this ſubject to be in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending them, when their Anger is as fierce, as their power is great; and in ſome Women, their paſſionate revengeful humor ſuitable to both: Therefore if the Apoſtle thought he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38135:60"/>had good reaſon to pray to be deliver'd from unreaſonable Men, ſure Men may alſo pray to be deliver'd from unreaſonable Women.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſs as it ſuits well with all the meaſures of true Reaſon, and good Policy, that thoſe who Command, ought to be wiſer than they who are to obey. And therefore Women ought not to uſe a Soveraignty over Mens Actions, whilſt they are Subjects to their own Paſſions, and ſure none can deny this Truth, that ſhe who cannot Rule her ſelf, is very unfit to Govern another.</p>
               <p>But 'tis full time for me to begin to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the argument of this dangerous Subject, having ſpent time enough in dabling my Pen on the brinks of it, for I did not dare venture farther, for fear I could not get out of it, ſo ſtrong and fierce, is the ſtream of <hi>female power,</hi> that like an <hi>unruly torrent</hi> it runs ſo violent, that I am afraid inſtead of making it my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to diſwade you againſt it; I fancy my ſecureſt way to defend my ſelf is by a retreat from it; for I find I can only act on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as good <hi>Pilots</hi> do in great <hi>Storms,</hi> who tho they cannot ſhew their power to make the winds obey them, yet they may ſhew their skill, in making the beſt uſe to have them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous. And ſo in <hi>Soldierſhip,</hi> in extremity of danger, a well made <hi>Retreat</hi> is as commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, as a great Victory obtain'd, and deſerves to be Crown'd with <hi>Laurel</hi> as well as with the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38135:60"/>
                  <hi>Trophies</hi> of a great Conqueſt, and that Soldier, who has only Courage to make a bold Charge, and wants skill to make a good Retreat, has learn'd but half that belongs to the making of a great Captain: We read that <hi>Homer the King of Poets,</hi> praiſed <hi>Achilles</hi> for underſtanding the great Art, of knowing how, and when to run away conveniently: Adverſity hath her <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> as well as Night has her <hi>Stars,</hi> and a great General may ſhew his good Conduct, in the midſt of his bad fortune, and ill ſucceſs. So I cannot but hope, that this my attempt in writing for the moderating Womens over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling power, was good, tho my ſucceſs in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing is but bad, and therefore I will give it over. And as Ships of War, fire Guns in their Retreat out of their Stern, ſo ſhall I here in the end of this Diſcourſe, diſcharge in my Retreat this farther Conſideration, That Wives over governing Power runs its Courſe quite contrary to the overflowing ſtreams of the <hi>River Nilus,</hi> for that by it produces great advantage where e'er it goes, without letting any know from whence it comes; but all Men, (and in a moſt eſpecial manner the Married,) can tell by woful experience, that Womens overflowing power, in governing their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, muſt and does produce ſad effects, and ſhameful diſorder where e're it goes.</p>
               <p>And do but ask one of theſe mean-ſpirited Husbands, from whence his Wives governing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38135:61"/>power comes, and he cannot deny, but it flows from the ſame ſpring his mean effeminate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor does, in allowing it, uſurpation; and I am ſure our <hi>father Adam,</hi> for being rul'd by his Wife, did juſtly receive, as well as truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, Gods wrath, and puniſhment for it, and therefore ſurely all ſuch mean, tame, pittiful govern'd Husbands, well deſerve all ſober Mens contempt and ſcorn as the juſt demerit of ſo ſhameful a condeſcenſion, which argues ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their want of wit or manhood. And now the only hope of Reformation that appears to me on this particular is, that <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>there's a time for all things, a time to mourn, and a time to rejoyce;</hi> ſo that there may be yet a time hereafter, for Wives to obey, as well as they have now to command, and when they will ſubmit as they ought to their Husbands Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, then they will certainly deſerve that praiſe and reſpect that is due to the honour of their Sex, and receive the admiration of all Mens juſt courtſhip and eſteem: then may be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Stage again, the old-faſhion Play, ſo very long out of date, (as few Husbands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it was ever Acted,) call'd <hi>Rule a Wife, and have a Wife,</hi> which indeed very few Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands dare ſay they do, (I mean before their Wives,) and few would be believ'd if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally did, ſo rare and ſtrange a thing is this thing call'd Wife obedience, as many believe 'tis only to be found at <hi>John Tredeskins,</hi> among his Collections of Antiquities.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:38135:61"/>
               <p>So that I muſt be forc'd to yield that this rare Woman temper of Wife obedience is a thing only to be hoped, not expected, and therefore I will not vainly ſtrive as <hi>Xerxes</hi> did, to level Mountains, nor with <hi>Nero,</hi> attempt to alter the Courſe of the Sea; but inſtead of endeavouring ſuch impoſſibilities, I will now wiſely reſolve, neither to trouble my ſelf, nor ruling Wives, to diſſwade them to leſſen their governing power, which I am ſure, would be a Task as hard for me to obtain, as that of <hi>Xerxes</hi> or <hi>Nero</hi> was to perform: Womens go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning power, being ſo long and deep rooted an uſurpation, poſſeſſed by ſo many Wives, and yielded to by ſo many Husbands, as long Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom has made it a Diſeaſe in moſt Husbands minds, incident like the infirmities of ſickneſs or age to their bodies, which commonly has ſuch diſtempers that attend it, that they are worthy of all Mens pity, tho' paſt all Mens cure: Therefore I will imitate your good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, who eſteem it unſafe to ſtir up thoſe humors, they cannot poſſibly purge away, and upon this conſideration I ſhall now muzle my Pen, and found a Retreat, eſteeming it more wiſe and ſafe, to think much, rather than write more on this extenſive and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Subject.</p>

                  <hi>THE FIFTH DISCOURSE,</hi> Of the inconſtancy of moſt young Ladies, eſpecially that are cry'd up beauties, and the folly of any one that believes he is fully acquainted, and ſolely poſſeſſed of a vain La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies heart, and can give good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the various motions of her Love-Changes.</head>
               <p>I Cannot deny but that young Womens Company may be very advantageous, as well as agreeable to young Men, as being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful to whet their Wit, to civilize their behaviour, and to poliſh their Diſcourſes; but yet they ought ſtill to remember, that the Converſation of theſe vain young gay Ladies, is to be us'd but like Sawce to Meat, good to quicken the Stomack, but bad to make a Meal on, being to be taken like ſtrong Cordials, not too much, nor too often, and therefore to make their viſits ſo moderate, as not to keep longer in their Company than juſt to refreſh and fit their minds for better employment, and by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38135:62"/>theſe means young Men may reliſh young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Converſation with great guſto, and return to them with a no leſs vertuous than agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inclination.</p>
               <p>But inſtead of obſerving theſe wiſe meaſures, moſt of our young Gallants, make Courting of handſom Women, not only their paſtime, but their buſineſs, ſo as to waſt all their Time, and uſe all their endeavors in the purſuit, and attempts of gaining every new handſom face they ſee, and if it be but new, it muſt be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and taking, if 'twere only for being new, on the modiſh account of ſweet variety.</p>
               <p>And truly moſt of our vain Ladies fall not at all ſhort of them in the ſame act of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, but are as extravagantly fooliſh, and as little real as they, and therefore if 'twere poſſible to perſwade young Gallants and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but to allow themſelves time ſeriouſly to conſider this matter, I am apt to think firſt that Men would be aſham'd of their folly to rely on the airy, fickle and inconſtant humors of moſt of our vain modiſh Ladies, eſpecially that are the cried up beauties, and theſe our fickle Ladies no leſs bluſh (I mean if their <hi>Peeter</hi> would give them leave,) at their indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion in receiving thoſe high praiſes, and believing thoſe great Complements, and often repeated Oaths, their young Gallants make them, when in real Truth, theſe Gallants are as much inconſtant to their Miſtriſſes as their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38135:63"/>Miſtriſſes can be to them, and their perjured Vows of conſtancy on both ſides, weigh as little in themſelves, as the breath that ſpeaks them, which immediatly vaniſhes into meer Air, without ever making the leaſt return, their Tongues and Hearts being ſo great ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as there's ſeldom any correſpondence between them; ſo that 'tis moſt certain that ſuch Men may very rationally extract out of Womens fickleneſs, this true Concluſion, that the more they confide, either on Chance, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or handſom Womens Conſtancy, (which are all three now a days much alike,) the more folly as well as falſehood they entertain in their relyance and depending on them.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John Sucklin</hi> was a perſon of great Wit and Parts, and not only highly eſteem'd of by the applauded witty Men, but by the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Ladies of his age, and was one who had made many Philoſophical Eſſays, on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering nature, and various windings of many of the Ladies humors, and inclinations, as far as an extraordinary Wit, a plentiful Fortune, a liberal Mind, an open Purſe, and a <hi>Venus</hi> heart, could carry him; and after having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd all theſe, with all the care and induſtry imaginable, he found moſt young Womens hearts, ſo volatile and inconſtant, and to come ſo far ſhort of real Truth, as nothing can be farther, which occaſion'd this noble <hi>Knight-Errant,</hi> to leave behind him in Print, this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38135:63"/>friendly Caution, that it might appear as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, as young Womens inconſtancy, or young Mens folly, who pretend to a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſole poſſeſſion of a young beauties heart; <hi>you that propound to your ſelves propriety in Love, know Womens hearts like ſtraws do move, and that which you vainly think is Sympathy with you, is really but Love to Jet in general.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed the moſt experienc'd <hi>Venus</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and enlightned Inſpectors into the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of moſt Womens hearts, and affections, are apt to make as groſs overſights, in their gueſſes, and fancies of their making good Wives, or true Lovers, as the ableſt Seamen do often commit miſtakes in their ſight at Sea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taking Land for Clouds, other times Clouds for Land.</p>
               <p>Really the very beſt and moſt able Maſters of Art, and moſt Critical Enquirers with their greateſt obſervations, and pretences of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as to the Motions of Ladies hearts, can only make ſuch imperfect gueſſes and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as Aſtronomers do of the Operation of the Stars, which is but by the great; they can give an account of the general order of Providence in their Stations and Motions, but can give no certain Rule, or true Meaſure to diſcern their Influences upon particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or bodies, no more, than they can give a reaſon, (other than Gods Will,) why conſtant ſucceſs attends this Mans undertakings, and a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38135:64"/>continued ill fortune waits on another Mans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, or why a wicked curſed Tyrant ſhould live out his Natural Life proſperouſly among his abuſed Vaſſals, and our highly excellent, and truly pious Martyr King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, of ever Bleſſed Memory, ſhould be barbarouſly Murder'd by his own free Subjects; which is a moſt clear and plain Leſſon of inſtruction, not to Judg the true right of Cauſes, by the falſe light of ſucceſſes, and therefore ſober religious Men, freely own their ignorance as to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cauſes, of the divers effects of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence as to the event of things in this world; there being ſuch an infinity of Cauſes that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on one another, that good and wiſe Chriſtians eſteem it their beſt and ſafeſt way, to live in a ſtate of Neutrality, as to a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge, of the effects of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Iſſues either of his Mercies or Judgments.</p>
               <p>And truly if our young Gallants were as wiſe as they ought to be, they would alſo live in a State of Neutrality, as to their Judgment of the motions of young Ladies fancies, and be ſatisfied with theſe general notions, that their minds, and inclinations are generally bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, who are young, handſom, rich, witty, high born, well bred, and the like; but how to diſcern ſpecial Cauſes, for particular Occurrences, and to be able to tell the true reaſons, and give the juſt meaſures, for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38135:64"/>ſo often differing and varying in their Love fancies, is I believe beyond the power of Man to Judge; ſome Women eſteeming the black before the fair, others the fair before the black, in which few agree; or this hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Man before t'other, and ſometimes an ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man before them both, Womens likings to Men, being like their mode of governing, who tho the power be ſtill the ſame and certain, yet the manner of it is always changeable and inconſtant.</p>
               <p>I ſay in all theſe changes or rovings of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the moſt knowing, and experienc'd Lovers, can make at very beſt but imperfect Gueſſes, almoſt as very uncertain as Womens Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or young Mens Love; which indeed is much of the nature of common Hay and Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which a little ſpark lights, and a ſmall time conſumes; young Men being more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant in their addreſſes, than very beauty in its duration, moſt of our young Gallants Love, being not able to keep up to the ſame degree of Elevation, as the ſhort ſpace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Miſtriſſes beauty does: In a word, I think the beſt Wit, and moſt knowing Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, cannot ſay better of the nature of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Love, than what S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid of the nature of the <hi>Times, I fancy I know it, when no body bids me deſcribe it, but find I am igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it, when any does.</hi>

                  </gap>es, guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Love choices by the clear Light, and true Rule of Reaſon, which occaſions their being ſo often miſled by the vain Love flaſhes of their preſent Airy fancy. And indeed when a young Mans alluring beauty, (or what elſe you pleaſe to call it,) attracts a young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſight, and thereby moves her fickle fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and inconſtant likings, and ſo ſtamps a fierce, but haſty impreſſion of Love on her tender ſlippery heart, which commonly makes the neweſt object, the richeſt prize, for indeed moſt of our modiſh Ladies Gallants are to them like the Faſhions, where uſually the laſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is beſt lik'd, and moſt us'd.</p>
               <p>And the Jeſt of it is, that many of theſe changeable Ladies being ſo ſmitten, are apt to believe that this their laſt Love is the only true one, and that all their former Loves were but a kind of Muſhrom Love, which ſprung up in a Night as Muſhroms do, without any Root; but that this their preſent Love is built on good reaſon, and true conſideration, and therefore ſhall be like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> unalterable, being ſo deeply engraven in their marble hearts as 'tis never to be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or worn out but by death, forgetting all the Changes they formerly made, and by the ſame Rule of Inconſtancy they may hereafter make, according to the taking objects which new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation may preſent, and that 'tis poſſible,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38135:65"/>if not probable, that their preſent paſſion of Love that is ſo newly kindled and fully lighted, may in ſome farther time be ſwallow'd up, and extinguiſhed by a more inviting beauty, that may preſent more charming and agreeable, and 'tis moſt certain that the Love which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes and inflames a young Ladies heart laſt, Eclipſes all former fancies, as the Suns appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance darkens all other Lights, the Sun being to be ſeen by no other light but his own. In ſhort, moſt Womens hearts, and Love vows of Conſtancy, are to be read but like ſtrange Prophecies, which are to be underſtood, not by their Words, but by their Events.</p>
               <p>Indeed moſt of our airy Ladies, are ſo vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and fickle in their Amours, as not only their Eyes, hearts and inclinations, but their whole nature is ſo addicted to change and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, as one might as eaſily fix Mercury, or make brickle Glaſs malleable, as to fix a young Womans humor, and love-fancy, ſo as not to break out into change and inconſtancy, they being more fickle and changable, than the very Wind it ſelf, for there are Trade Winds that blow ſtill certainly one way all the Year, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever altering from the ſame Point and Place; but a vain Ladies Conſtancy, is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be found at any time, or in any place, their Love-humors being like the <hi>Camelions</hi> Colours, whoſe property is to have no certain one. So that 'tis no wonder to find a young
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:38135:66"/>Woman that is inconſtant, but a greater one to find one that is not; the Earth being not more variable in all her Properties, nor the Heaven in all its Influences, than moſt of the vain great beauties are in their Love-fancies; and ſure if the Baſis and ground-work of their whole Love-nature be ſandy, the more Men foundation on their Conſtancy, (I mean only in point of Love) the more they expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their deceit, and conſequently to creating their miſery.</p>
               <p>Therefore I am clearly of opinion, that as to Ladies Conſtancy, when the greateſt Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks have made their moſt ſtudious Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and Eſſay'd their moſt ſubtil experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, on all the points of Loves Compaſs, they muſt own their Ignorance touching the various ways and diverſity of motions of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens minds, ſince Love often works upon their Imaginations, and flies to their Hearts, as Bluſhes do to their Faces, which they can neither command their going, or hinder their coming, ſince they ſtill go and come at their own rate; therefore I am fully of opinion, that the moſt able Artiſts, Naturaliſts, and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Philoſophers with all their ſpeculative Rules and Meaſures, ought to ſtrike Sail, and yield to common practical experience, as to the Choices of young Womens ſeveral fancies in their Love-likings; and to grant that Mens beſt Logick will be to Argue, in moſt young
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:38135:66"/>Womens way of Arguing, 'Tis ſo, becauſe 'tis ſo.</p>
               <p>Since then the diſcovery of the Ebbing and Flowing of young Womens hearts and minds, are like that of the Sea, a wonderful Motion, expoſed to the publick view of all, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd from the true knowledg of any, for one may as rationally hope to find the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Stone, that turns all Metals into Gold, as to find the Art of turning all young Ladies Love-fancies ſo as to meet in one Centre of Conſtancy; which is as impoſſible as to be able to meaſure the Sea with your Span, or what's as feaſible, to fathom the depth of a young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans inclinations, with the Plummet of your reaſon, their changable Love being as very far from true certainty, as almoſt the drop of Ink that writes this is from the Ocean: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall end this Diſcourſe with this ſerious Conſideration, and Reſolution, that ſince 'tis not in the power of Man to find it out, fairly to leave it as ſuch, and hereafter only to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, at ones wondring, at my not being able to diſcover the various humors, and intricate windings of young Womens minds at all times, when few of them know their own at any time.</p>

                  <hi>THE SIXTH DISCOURSE,</hi> Of Marriage, and Wives who uſurp a governing Power over their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, which is now ſo common, as it's become almoſt the general grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Nation.</head>
               <p>THere are of Wives, as of moſt other things, two ſorts, the good and the bad; the good preſents the Husband with much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and great Content; and the bad creates as much miſery and diſſatisfaction: The firſt is a kind of Heaven, the ſecond a ſort of Hell upon Earth, for there can be no Purgatory ſeated in the mid way between them; for out of Purgatory 'tis poſſible to be redeem'd for Mony, but from Marriage 'tis impoſſible to be ranſom'd but by death. All I ſhall ſay of Purgatory is, that if there's ſuch a Place, (which I cannot believe) tho' it may be much viſited, yet I fancy 'tis little inhabited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch as have Mony may buy themſelves out of it, and thoſe that have none, are not worth keeping in it.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:38135:67"/>
               <p>I ſhall here only name ſome of the main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients that go to make up the Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a real happy Marriage, to compleat which there muſt be on both ſides, hearty love, and true liking; that ſo they may joyn their Hearts, as well as the Miniſter does their Hands, and as their Marriage Vow makes them tho two, but one Fleſh; ſo it muſt make them both, to be but of one Mind, and one Concern, which is, to pleaſe one another; and to this good Conſort of Humors, and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there muſt be added a like degree of Age, and a ſuitable manner of breeding as well as an equality of Families and Fortunes, and all theſe Flowers are to be bound up into a ſweet and well made Noſegay, by a fervent Zeal, and a holy love to Piety and Vertue, for without a mixture of theſe, the Married Couple, do but found their happineſs on the Sand, and build all their hopes of Content, with untempered Mortar; for tho 'tis as true as common, that meer beauties do often breed great fondneſs, yet it can never create true Love; for beauty is but the ſlight fading var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh of the Face which ſoon wears off, but Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is the ſubſtantial laſting beauty of the Mind, and makes a handſom fine Lady, like the Kings Daughter all glorious within, and preſerves her Marriage Love in a ſweet, and perfect Harmony, without which, it can have no duration, but muſt ſoon fade, and ravel out into change and inconſtancy.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:38135:68"/>
               <p>And now I muſt tell you, I know not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly where to direct you to find the great rarity of ſuch a happy well match'd Couple; but this I know, that where e'er they are to be found about this Kingdom, 'tis a thouſand pities that death ſhould ever take them out of it becauſe they are ſo very hard to be found in it.</p>
               <p>And now I have nam'd ſome of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Ingredients, that are abſolutely neceſſary to compleat a happy Marriage, I hope I ſhall not need here name any of thoſe great Faults, and ill Humors, which go to the making up the Compoſition of a bad Wife, but ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to the next Husband you meet, and know, who can certainly tell you by woful experience ſome of them that his Wife has, and the next you inquire after may tell you more, for every Husband can tell you more or leſs of his Wives faults; for there is no Husband but knows ſome, and 'tis well if ſhe has not ſome more than he knows, ſo that I ſhall only need tell you here by whole-ſail, that as many Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures joyn'd together make a great Sum, ſo many great Faults and croſs peeviſh ill humors united in one Woman make an ill Wife.</p>
               <p>Now if you would know the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch Husbands, who eſteem themſelves in their Wives very happy, and thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themſelves to be made by them very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. Of the firſt kind, the Husband thinks, as good as his Wife is, that there cannot be a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38135:68"/>Wife that has no fault, the other thinks that there can be no fault, but what his Wife has; ſo that the ſum total of this difference is eaſily caſt up in theſe few words, as to the belief that good, and bad Husbands have of their Wives faults, that all Wives have ſome, and ſome Wives have all.</p>
               <p>But this truth, neither the good or bad Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band can deny, that tho there are as well bad as good ſucceſſes in Mens choice of Wives, and Wives choice of Husbands, yet that does not at all leſſen, or take from, the holy Inſtitution of Marriage; which is pure and comfortable in it ſelf, tho more are made miſerable than happy by it, Marriage being a Sacred Order, not only as old as our father <hi>Adam,</hi> but almoſt as Nature her ſelf, for it began with the World, and is not like to end but with it, and can truly boaſt, both of the greateſt Antiquity for its Parent, and the firſt rank of Miracles for its honour; for Scripture tells us, <hi>that the firſt Miracle our bleſſed Saviour did in</hi> Canaa <hi>was at a Wedding,</hi> and we read in <hi>Geneſis, that God had no ſooner fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Creating the World, but he preſently acted a Miracle in it, by making a Marriage, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of which, he miraculouſly divided one body into two, and united two bodies into one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in thoſe bleſſed days of purity and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, before ſin began to reign in the World, God the great Maker, and wiſe diſpoſer of all things, thought one Husband ſufficient for one
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38135:69"/>Wife, and one Wife for one Husband; but in our wicked Age of exceſs, wantonneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, there are crowds of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that liſt themſelves into the holy Order of Matrimony, that will not confine themſelves to thoſe limited bounds which God himſelf gave, and they themſelves vow'd to keep, but will rather chooſe thoſe Adulterous courſes God has forbid, than uſe thoſe lawful means, which God has given by Marriage: But 'tis a ſin deſcends to us from our father <hi>Adam;</hi> to leave all the lawful fruit in the Garden, to eat of the forbidden Tree.</p>
               <p>And now I fancy it need not paſs for Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or a meer Romantick expreſſion, to ſay, 'Twould be now another Wedding Miracle in <hi>England,</hi> to ſee our vain modiſh Ladies as juſt and obedient to their Husbands as they ought to be, or indeed our foppiſh young Gallants, as kind, and conſtant to their Wives as they ſhould be; for we are got into ſuch a Brood of ill Wives, and bad Husbands, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hunt in Couples, one ſtill helping to make the other as infamous as they can, and ſo as many of the bad Wives think one Husband too little, ſo many of theſe ill Husbands think one Wife too much.</p>
               <p>Now if any wonder at this new faſhion, of ranking in writing, the Wife before the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, I fancy they will not much admire at it, when I tell them my reaſon is, becauſe 'tis the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:38135:69"/>Wives right from the very beginning of the World, to take place and go before her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; but yet you ought not to be either pleas'd or proud of it, when I remember you in what manner you took place, and went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Husband, which was only in ſinful diſobedience, a miſery Wives ought ever to mourn for, but never to boaſt of, and which is ſo far from a new faſhion, as we may read in Scripture 'tis as very old as the firſt Woman, and afforded <hi>Adam</hi> no other excuſe for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſwaded to diſobedience by his Wife, than that <hi>the Woman beguiled me, and I did eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> orders the Wife to be ſubject to her Husband, and gives this reaſon for it, for firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was made, then <hi>Eve,</hi> to ſhew 'tis the Mans place to go firſt, and the Woman to follow the Man, and not the Man to follow the Woman, ſo that 'tis moſt clear by the Law of God, the Woman was made for the Man, and formed the weaker Veſſel; but by our new <hi>Engliſh</hi> practice, it ſeems to paſs for good currant modiſh doctrin, that the Man was created for the Woman, and made the weaker Veſſel, elſe ſure Men would never endure, that ſo very many Wives ſhould rule their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and ſo very few Husbands ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their Wives.</p>
               <p>The ſubtil <hi>Lawyers</hi> that can talk the craftieſt Men out of their mony; (ſome giving them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38135:70"/>only but talk for their mony) cannot yet talk their Wives into due obedience, many of them only laughing at their Husbands threats of bringing Writs of Errors, and Actions of Treſpaſs, againſt them, for uſurping and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing an unlawful governing power over them, which tho contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the fundamental Law of this Kingdom, and all other Laws whatſoever, except that of Cuſtom, yet Lawyers Wives will keep this Law in full force, (I am ſure they cannot ſay, and vertue) for they break all Laws, both divine and human by it.</p>
               <p>Nor can our Miniſters with all their Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal gravity, Divine Rhetorick, and eloquent Preaching, teach their Wives ſo effectually S. <hi>Pauls</hi> leſſon of ſubmiſſion as to make them pay them ſo much as the Tythe of obedience, for if they could, ſure they would never ſuffer them to wear ſuch rich Clothes, which is not only unſuitable to the gravity and decency of a <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Mans Wife,</hi> but very contradictory to the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrin, who orders in general all Women, and ſure Miniſters Wives above all, not to adorn themſelves with rich, but modeſt Apparel; nor can our great Merchants that Plow the Seas with their Ships to all Kingdoms of the World, in all their long Voyages, and great dealings, purchaſe any conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of this rare Commodity, call'd Wife obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and let me tell them, not for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38135:70"/>if they can buy none of it abroad, they will hardly find any given them at home.</p>
               <p>Nay I may yet go farther, and ſay, that the greateſt, and moſt wiſe Stateſmen with all their Politicks, cannot make their Wives pay them their juſt obedience, and I fancy their Husbands eſteem it a great part of their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and prudence not to expect it, becauſe probably they in great wiſdom do ſeriouſly reflect on the ſtate of their <hi>Adam,</hi> who though he had all the Wit and Wiſdom, Policy and Power, of the whole World ſolely and intirely in himſelf, yet when he got a Wife, or rather a Wife got him, we all know to his high ſhame, and our great miſery, that ſhe govern'd him, not he her; by which all Husbands may receive this ſmall Conſolation, that Wives uſurping the Government, is no new Error, but as old almoſt as the Creation.</p>
               <p>All I ſhall ſay to our Nobility and Gentry on this ſad Subject of Wives governing their Husbands, is only to deſire moſt of them to lay their hands on their Hearts, and then tell me if ſeeing is not believing. In truth one need go no farther than the Streets to meet many Men that do not govern their Wives, but one muſt travel the whole Kingdom over to meet a few that do.</p>
               <p>We find that Springs which move only by the meer courſe of Nature, will mount no higher than their Heads, becauſe 'tis againſt Nature
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:38135:71"/>to do it, and if we may believe S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and he is no good Chriſtian that does not, he tells us that the Husband is the head of the Wife, and if the Wife will but believe that, ſure ſhe cannot tell how to deny this, that <hi>Africa</hi> it ſelf, can produce nothing more monſtrous, than for a Woman to grow above her head, which being the uppermoſt part of the body, nothing can grow above it, for if it did, then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the uppermoſt part. Sure ſuch ſilly beaſt-like Husbands, that do not know their own ſtrength, and ſo allow the <hi>Prerogative</hi> power of Governing to be in the Wife, could never wonder at <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Prodigy, that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhould be wiſer than the <hi>Rider.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly this ſort of Wives that make it their Practice, and believe it their right, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a Sovereignty over their Husbands, <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read, or forgot they ever did, S.</hi> Pauls <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, I ſuffer not the Woman to exerciſe an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the Man,</hi> God firſt <hi>Created Male, then Female,</hi> Gods command to the Wife to be ſubject to her Husband, was given as long ago as the firſt Woman, and really I believe, 'twill be as long hence as the laſt Wife, before it be ſtrictly obſerv'd by a general concurrence of obedience, if one may judge of all Wives, by the common rate moſt now adays govern at, and what's worſe, are like to do, for 'tis moſt certain, that long Cuſtom makes a firm Law, and what Men are long acquainted with, they are uſually well contented at.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:38135:71"/>
               <p>I have heard ſome of thoſe high-ſpirited go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Wives, that have been ſo wickedly fooliſh, as to borrow ſome of the Devils ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry to argue with, that becauſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Wife obedience, is as old as the firſt Woman, and was then only given to one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that beyond the memory of any Man, that therefore it ought now to be out of the practice of all Women of our times, eſpecially of ſuch as are modiſh and witty, and conſequently unfit for them to follow; but thoſe that inſtead of paying obedience, make it their ſport to railly at Gods Commands, let ſuch expect that Gods Judgment without rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery will follow them; be not deceived, God will not be mocked.</p>
               <p>There was among this Hectoring brood of Women, a Parſon's Wife that govern'd her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as too many of them do, but could not govern her Tongue, as too many of them do not, who was ſo very ſenſeleſs, as to ask in a jeering ranting manner a grave learned Miniſter that came to viſit her Husband who was not very well, (and indeed no wonder, for his brains were never well in their right order ſince his Wife firſt govern'd him) what S. <hi>Paul</hi> could mean by that ſaying, <hi>the Woman is the weaker Veſſel.</hi> To which the learned Miniſter grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reply'd, <hi>Truly Madam Governeſs what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle meant I know not, except your Sex was the weaker Veſſel in diſcretion and Continency.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:38135:72"/>
               <p>Indeed 'twere much better for theſe high-ſpirited governing Wives, to conſider how they can exempt themſelves of that great profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of daring to vie Miracles with the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as in effect all governing Wives do, for as God wrought a Miracle by taking the Woman out of the Man, ſo they would act another, by turning the Man into the Woman; but Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are ceaſed, and I wiſh for the public good that all governing Wives power were ſo too; but if that were, ſome may object, that then Miracles cannot be ceaſed, ſince that would be a new and great Miracle indeed.</p>
               <p>Really if Wives were but as wiſe as they ought, then they would conſider as they ſhould do, and conſtantly obſerve, what they cannot but ſtill truly believe, that 'tis Gods poſitive Command, that the Wife ſhould be in ſubjection to her Husband.</p>
               <p>And now if I ſhould ask one of theſe ranting governing Wives, this Queſtion, how ſhe can pretend to exempt her ſelf from the foul fact, of beheading her Husband; I really believe it would puzle her to give a rational and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory anſwer, for if the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Husband is the head of the Wife, means that the Husband as head has the governing power over the Wife, which certainly is the true ſenſe of theſe words, and no Wife that has ſence can deny it; then the Head ſignifying the Power, and the Power the Head, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38135:72"/>muſt neceſſarily of courſe follow. That the Head being the Husbands governing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Wife that cuts off the Husbands go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Power, cuts off the Husbands head, for if ſhe will allow the firſt, ſhe can hardly deny the latter; but I ſhall end this Diſcourſe, and ſeriouſly conclude, that if Husbands were as wiſe as they ought, governing Wives would not be ſo numerous as they are, nor rule ſo much as they do; for then Men would never yield up ſo tamely and meanly their birthright of governing power, which the Law both of God and Man, (and I wiſh I could ſay the Law of Cuſtom too,) has given the Husband over the Wife, that ſo it might become here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after as ſtrange in <hi>England</hi> to hear of a Wife that does govern her Husband, as now 'tis to hear of a Wife that does not; and that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wives may be as very ſcarce, as now they are very common, and as much out of faſhion, as now they are in.</p>
               <p>But methinks I hear ſome blaming me for being unreaſonably ſevere, in writing againſt governing Wives in general, when I cannot but own that there are ſome governing Wives that for being ſo, are not blameable, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, which are ſuch prudent ſober Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as are Married to fooliſh ſottiſh Men, who if their Wives did not govern, they could not govern themſelves, and ſo their great noble Eſtates would ſoon be waſted, and moulder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38135:73"/>into a fooliſh and ſhameful ruin; which by their Wives wiſe and diſcreet management is prevented. To which I anſwer, that there's no general Rule without an exception, and beſides I do not deſign this Diſcourſe againſt ſuch go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Wives, as find their Husbands fools, but againſt thoſe Wives as make their Husbands ſuch meerly by their governing them; but if a Husband be ſo fooliſhly blind in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he cannot ſee the right way to order his Perſon, and Eſtate, 'tis a neceſſary duty and kindneſs of his Wife to govern him, and his fortune, and to lead him out of all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and inconveniencies he might run both it, and himſelf into, and ſuch a Wife deſerves no more blame, for governing ſuch a Husband, than a Servant does for leading about his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and ſhewing him the way, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee to find it being quite blind: But yet this governing power a Wife muſt perform with great reſpect and civility to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, by leſſening, and ſheltering his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all perſons as much as poſſibly ſhe can, that all may ſee, the occaſion of her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not an Act of Pride, but a Work of pure neceſſity; not her delight, but trouble. In a word, ſhe muſt be very far from ſaying of her Husband, what a ranting Widow did, that had three Husbands and govern'd them all, and for her fourth ſhe choſe a meer Fool, and being ask'd her reaſon, ſhe anſwer'd, ſhe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:38135:73"/>was grown Lazy, and therefore Married a Fool, to ſave her ſelf the trouble of making him one.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>THE SEVENTH DISCOURSE,</hi> Of the Inequality of many Marriages, and the Inconſtancy of moſt Wives, that Men Marry for meer Beauty, or their Parents Match for bare Mony, with the ſad end that uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſuch Matches.</head>
               <p>IN my Opinion, the great reaſon why diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing Marriages are now grown ſo rife, is becauſe unequal Matches are now become ſo common, moſt Parents making it more their buſineſs to Match well Portions and Eſtates, than Sons and Daughters; and ſo their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes do but ſuit well, no matter if their Age, Humors, and Inclinations agree ill; many Parents making it more their concern to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide their Children plenty of Livelihood, than contentedneſs of Living, being much more taken with a great Gingling of Guinnies, than with a Sweet Conſort of Vertues, or a good Pedigree of Gentility, which occaſions ſome fine great Ladies to have rich Husbands, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:38135:74"/>fair Eſtates, and yet but bad Fortunes, to be well Married, and yet but ill Match'd, becauſe they do not fancy, and ſo are not ſatisfied with one another.</p>
               <p>Content and Happineſs are Twins, born out of the ſame Womb, and ſpring out of the ſame Root, and none can be content with what he does not like, no more than diſcontented with what he does; for if he likes, he muſt be content, elſe he does not like. And 'tis alſo the ſame, where there's no Content, there can be no Love; for if he loves he muſt be content with what he Loves, elſe he does not Love, and where there's no Content and liking, there can hardly be any true Conſtancy, for none can affect a Conſtancy to that they do not like, but their Mind is ſtill in purſuit after that they do.</p>
               <p>Moſt Parents in Marrying their Children, are ſure to remember <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſaying, That <hi>Mony anſwers all things,</hi> but forget his meaning, that is purchaſable with it; for ſeveral young Ladies that are richly Married, can tell by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful experience, that much Mony cannot ſtill buy true Content, ſince many of them have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle content, in the midſt of their much Mony.</p>
               <p>And farther, common experience, which is uſually the effect of reaſon, aſſures us that it cannot purchaſe many things, as to give ſight to the Blind, or Youth to the Aged, or what's equally impoſſible as both, to create Love againſt liking. 'Tis true indeed that Guinnies
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:38135:74"/>do often tye a faſt Matrimonial Knot, but of themſelves can never tye a true Lovers one, ſince no Medicine that has not a mixture of the Sympathetick Powder, can operate kindly on young Womens minds; for as nothing can force a Mans belief contrary to his own reaſon, ſo nothing can compel a Womans Love againſt her own liking. 'Tis true one may be forced to obey at the rate of a Tyrants Will, but 'tis as true that none can believe or Love but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to their own reaſon or fancy, which made the great Tyrant <hi>Nero</hi> ſay, <hi>that he had much rather be fear'd, than lov'd;</hi> becauſe ſaid he, <hi>they that fear me, fear me after my rate, but thoſe that love me, love me after their own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed moſt of theſe Matches that are made up on the account of Intereſt, and not Love, their kindneſs is but like a Winters Sun, faint, and of no duration, and tho it may now and then in ſome time of the Day, ſhine bright and clear to the Eyes of Spectators, yet it carries no true heat with it, and therefore can never bring forth any ripe fruit of true content or ſatisfaction; and indeed no wonder ſince ſuch a Winter Sun's Love can produce none of the pleaſant Fruit of Marriage delights, when the Days civilities between them are very Faint, and the Night Embraces very Cold; for theſe Matches of meer Conveniency, that are made up only for great ſums of Mony, or meer fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful beauty, no ſooner that the Wives beauty
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:38135:75"/>is gone, or the Husbands Mony ſpent, (they being the only Cement, that faſtned a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon civility between them,) but the unbeau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Wife appears diſagreeable to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. And the Monyleſs Husband, ſeems contemptible to the Wife, and both Husband and Wife, become not only unpleaſing, but deſpiſable the one to the other.</p>
               <p>There was an <hi>Italian</hi> that writ a great Book in praiſe of good Wives, and concluded there was but one good Wife in all the world, and ſaid that was enough for all, ſince every Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that truly lov'd his Wife, might fancy 'twas her; but by the <hi>Italians</hi> leave, tho one good Wife that is truſted abroad, is more by one, than is in all <hi>Italy,</hi> for no Husband in that Jealous Country will venture on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Experiment, of truſting his Wife abroad in Mens Company, to try whether ſhe be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous or not, much of the Wives Chaſtity there depending on their Husbands ſtrict watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs over them; the <hi>Italians</hi> eſteeming it a moſt excellent and Sovereign Antidote to hinder their Wives from becoming kind to Men, is to prevent Mens being able to come to be kind to their Wives; for every <hi>Italian</hi> carries ſtill about him, this old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proverb, <hi>That 'tis the occaſion makes the Thief,</hi> nay and obſerves it with more reverence and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, than all the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:38135:75"/>
               <p>But in <hi>England</hi> there are many vertuous Wives, that go where they will, and keep what Mens company they pleaſe; but this great truſt of free liberty, is not convenient to be extended to all Women, ſince ſometimes Husbands by it, ſhew more confidence in their Wives, than diſcretion in themſelves; and as too much liberty ſpoils ſome Wives, ſo a ſtrict watchful Jealouſie, makes many Wives worſe than they would be, by believing them worſe than they truly are; for doubtleſs many Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands make their Wives diſhoneſt by miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; for that breeds anger, and hatred, and they often create revenge, which ſome hot Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh ſpirits will act upon any account, tho they themſelves are the greateſt ſufferers by it.</p>
               <p>I eſteem Jealouſie to be a moſt ridiculous folly, not only becauſe Jealous Men, eagerly ſeek, what they highly dread to find; but if a Man had more Eyes than <hi>Argos,</hi> yet as <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos</hi> was, he may be deceiv'd by a ſimple Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; for if a Woman will but put on the wickedneſs of the Devil, ſhe will not fail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furniſhed with the ſubtilty of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
               <p>And therefore it often happens, that great and wiſe Stateſmen in the Politicks of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, who truſt in their Wives vertuous words, great modeſty, and ſtrict outward behaviour, may be deceiv'd; for unvertuous thoughts and deſigns are uſually diſguiſed and ſet out in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:38135:76"/>finer expreſſions, than plain honeſt dealing, and thoſe commonly promiſe moſt, that mean to perform leaſt, becauſe they intend to pay in no other Coin than bare words and falſe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances; and therefore none ought to wonder if great Politicians as well as others, are now and then deceiv'd in their Wives vertue. We read that <hi>Sampſon</hi> with all his Strength, tho he could not be out-witted by all the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,</hi> was over-reached by the ſubtilty of a Woman.</p>
               <p>A ſtrict ſeeming outward modeſty, is not ſtill an infallible ſign of a Wives true inward Vertue; ſince 'tis not extraordinary to ſee a Woman look like a Saint before Company, and act like a Miſs in private; for many hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Women, that are of a good coming and melting nature, aſſoon as you are a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into their acquaintance, and favour, yet ſeem very coy and ſevere at firſt entrance into it, imitating the Sea, which tho never ſo quiet and calm in the main, yet ſtill caſteth out rough waves near the ſhore.</p>
               <p>And now, whatſoever men may think of me, I am ſure my meaning is truly friendly, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing them, that if they are in the happy ſtate of freedom, not to yoak their Liberty in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for meer Beauty, or bare Mony, but chiefly for vertue and goodneſs; for if you but conſider ſeriouſly, you will find certainly, that the miſery of an ill Wife, is no new affliction,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:38135:76"/>but as very an old one as Marriage, and almoſt Nature it ſelf, witneſs <hi>Adam</hi> who lived in a continued innocency, and felicity whilſt he remained in the Paradice of a ſingle Life, but he was no ſooner Married to <hi>Eve,</hi> but he was caſt out of both.</p>
               <p>And 'tis moſt certain, let your Love range over Court, Town and Country, nay ramble over the whole World, you can never chooſe a Wife, that is not her Daughter; and common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience tells us, that there are few Daughters that do not favour ſomething of their Mothers humor, as well as nature, and therefore 'twill be highly prudential in this ſad and weighty affair, to conſider that Marrying a bad Wife, (as 'tis more than an even Lay one does,) has ſomething in it of the nature of that ſin, for which men can have no repentance or pardon, no more than they can have any eaſe, or relief for it while they live; for one may as well pretend to free Deaths Priſoners from the Grave, as unchain the Married during their Lives; no Skill of the greateſt Artiſt, nor yet Argument of the moſt ſubtile <hi>Socinian,</hi> can ever evade or looſe a Wedding Knot, it being of an extraordinary laſting Union, quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from all others, for Men can unbind all others whilſt they live, but a Marriage Vow, can only be unbound by death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And now I have given you this part of my Opinion as to meer Mony, or beauty Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:38135:77"/>which many Husbands may truly call in the Apoſtles phraſe, (tho ſpoke in another and more divine ſenſe,) <hi>That Labor of Love.</hi> I hope 'twill not appear an extraordinary fault, in ſaying it. S. <hi>Paul</hi> had foreſeen the Romantic Gallantry, and extravagant folly, (I think, I might have ſaid madneſs,) of many Marriages made now adays, which ſome of our vain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate Ladies are drawn into, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon report, that ſuch a Man has a great Eſtate, which ſuits well with her eager deſire to keep a Coach and ſix Horſes, (which ſhe vainly fancies, will not only carry her thorow all the miſeries of Marriage, but into the Towring pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime of the Park) without the leaſt concern of getting a good prudent ſober religious Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, many of them not valuing, or at leaſt not conſidering other, than the keeping a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Retinue, and glittering train of Liveries, than wearing rich Clothes adorn'd with Gold, and coſtly Pearl, when there are a hundred more weighty concerns, that are more needful Appendencies to compleat a happy Marriage.</p>
               <p>Really this is one of the chief Cauſes why ſuch Marriage Love decays, and wears out with their Wedding Coaches, and is as often out of order as they, ('twere well if they ſtill could be as eaſily mended) which none ought to wonder at, it being but natural for effects to follow their Cauſes.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:38135:77"/>
               <p>Among all the great and extravagant follies that are uſed in the inequalities of Marriages in our days, there's none appears to me more irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and unnatural, than an old Mans Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a young Woman, which in my Opinion ſeems a Match fitter to make ſport for others, than to raiſe joy to themſelves; for an old Man is to his young Wifes Bed, but like juice of Orange to her Stomack; it may create in her an Appetite, but of it ſelf can never ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it; ſuch an old Man being not only unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, undecent, but unwholeſom too, being to her like a <hi>March Sun,</hi> which all the great Phyſitians concur in opinion, to be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthful, as having only ſtrength to exhale Humors, but wants force to diſſolve them; ſo that ſuch a Match is ſo great a folly, as I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here need name one ſhameful miſery that commonly attends it, and indeed I need name I think no other, either to fortifie my opinion againſt it, or to ſet out ones miſery for doing it, which is this, That an old Man that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a handſom young Woman, tho his Wife may be ſo vertuous as not to Cuckold him, yet the world is ſo wicked in its reports to Cenſure him, ſo as it will always; which minds me of a ſtory of a Gentleman, whom both his Wife, and Neighbours agreed to proclaim the truth of his being a Cuckold, and ſhe dying, he Married an old ugly rigid <hi>Puritan,</hi> that was ſo odiouſly deformed as he was ſatisfied,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:38135:78"/>ſhe wanted Power, and the world Charity enough to Cuckold him, for 'twas impoſſible there could be a ſpark of Love, or liking in the Caſe, and he did believe that this Wife would not only be a perfect Antidote againſt horns for the time to come, but a Remedy for what was paſt; but one of his Neighbours being of a contrary belief call'd him Cuckold, upon which he repaired to his learned Counſellor in the Law, to know if his preſent Wife being honeſt, (though his former was not ſo,) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was ſtill a Cuckold, or not? to which his learned Lawyer gravely anſwered him, <hi>That tho he was not one in pure ſtrictneſs of Law, yet being once ſo, the Cuſtom of the Country, was ſo civil as to give him the Title during his Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I have given you my opinion, and told you the uſual fate that attends old Mens Marrying young Women; next comes that of young Womens Marrying old Men, and tho they appear both alike fooliſh, yet there's great difference in their folly, for as by this ſort of Matches, old Men glut themſelves with much more of the Woman than their age wants; ſo young Wives (if vertuous) ſtint themſelves with much leſs of the Husband than their Youth needs, and beſides tho Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage has the power tounite two Bodies into one Fleſh, yet it wants that of uniting the two Fleſhes into one temper or Conſtitution; for a young Wife that is in the Spring of her age, is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:38135:78"/>like the Sun in the Spring of the Year, it not only gets the aſcendant every day higher and higher, but grows every day more ſtrong and vigorous; but an old Husband, is like <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn,</hi> whoſe ſtrength goes only downward.</p>
               <p>Therefore I fancy an old Man Marrying a handſom young Lady, has nothing to plead, but <hi>Guilty;</hi> but a young Lady for Marrying an old Man, may have ſome colourable excuſe, to moderate the folly, and leſſen the ſhame of ſuch an unequal Match; for perhaps ſhe'll tell you, ſhe has heard a ſtory, which if as true as ſtrange is a rare one, <hi>That the reaſon that Stags live ſo very long, is, that when they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to decay, they ſwallow a live Serpent, and as it conſumes in their body, they revive in their ſtrength and Spirits.</hi> So poſſibly a young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will ſay, <hi>That ſhe did not Marry an old Man for being rich in Years, but Mony, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe found her Fortune decaying, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt quite decayed;</hi> therefore ſhe ſwallowed a Marriage with an old Man, as the Stag does a Serpent, in hopes that as her Husband con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes and dies in her boſom, ſo ſhe may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive in her ſprightly gay humor, and pleaſe her ſelf with the delightful thoughts of the wealth he will leave her, and the ways ſhe will In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue to ſpend it in the fanciful hopes ſhe has, of ſuddenly gaining a young Husband ſuitable both to her Youth, and aiery Inclinations.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:38135:79"/>
               <p>There is another ſort of Women, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their number is very ſmall, who being not handſom in their own opinion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may beſafely concluded very ugly in that of all others, who to ſupply the defects of nature and age, give out they are very rich, and that they hope will make amends for all, Gold being always young, handſom and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to all ſorts of Men, and Ages, for <hi>Mony anſwers all things,</hi> and by theſe reports of their Wealth, tho often falſe, they decoy young Fops who have loſt their Annuity at Play, or ſpent it in Debauchery, to Court them for their fame of having much Mony, and too eagerly preſs the Marrying them for it, Swearing that they Love their perſons more than their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, valuing them a thouſand times before it; and no wonder that they that ſwear ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly for nothing, ſhould now lye for much Mony; for in real truth they only put the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow before the Mony, as we do in common ſpeaking, the Box before the Jewels, which though firſt, is altogether inconſiderable to the latter, as only containing that Riches, which it ſelf makes no part of.</p>
               <p>And many of theſe old rich Widows are ſo doatingly ſenſeleſs, that becauſe their Mony Courters, ſwear they are handſom, they verily believe they are ſo, and credit others words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their own eyes, tho their ſpectacles are on, which renders ſome ſo ſottiſhly impudent, as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:38135:79"/>to tell their Gallants, that tho their beauty is in the fall of the Leaf, yet Autumn can breed Lovers as well as the Spring does, when in truth, an old withered Autumn face, does but Chill the blood, and diſpirit the vigour of the moſt active and reſolute Courtier; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Spring beauty can only enflame the heart, and tho poſſibly a young Man may be ſometimes fooliſhly taken with an old Womans great wit, good humor, or rather greater ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; yet 'tis, I think, impoſſible he can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Love with her deform'd face, perſon, or age, which muſt quench the fire of any amorous flames in a youthful or vigorous heart.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſhall adviſe all ſuch Women, to be ſo prudent as to yield to the ſeaſons of Age, as they muſt to that of the Year, and not hope to turn Winter into Summer, or Autumn into Spring; but inſtead of ſtriving for what's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, yield to what's reaſonable, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to theſe true Meaſures, That Eighteen is the gay ſprightly bloſſom age that a young Womans Life ſhines out in its brighteſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and beauty: That Thirty is the ſtale year of a Maid, and the worſt age of a Wife, (I mean that's an ill one,) becauſe a Wife at Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is old enough to be ugly, and young enough to live long; but a Woman that is ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in years as the frigid Zone of Sixty, ought in all reaſon to baniſh all vain Love thoughts, as to the youthful pleaſures of this
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:38135:80"/>world, and to fix them on the other, ſo as to live only in order to die, imitating the good old Woman named in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.37. <hi>Who kept in the Temple, who faſted and prayed to God night and day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed it becomes old Women much better to frequent the Church with the good old Godly Matrons ſo renown'd for gravity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in former days, than to viſit the Park or the Play, with their vain young Gallants, leſt their old Dreſs, and Antick Faces, ſhould make Men ſay, ſuch a one is more fit to be a Spectacle, than a Spectator; wants good Mens Prayers, rather than young Mens Praiſes; and is more apt to create thoughts of Mortality, than to raiſe motions of Love; really I am of opinion that if 'twere poſſible to turn beauty into the ſame nature of content, that the little Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> would ſwarm now more with handſom Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, than the Country of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> did ever with fighting Men, of which Scripture makes mention of many hundred thouſands, for than every ugly Woman, young or old, as thought her ſelf handſom, (as moſt do,) muſt be really handſom only for think it, as well as all thoſe that believe themſelves Content muſt be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or elſe they could not believe themſelves ſo; therefore all old, and ugly Women, that are not paſt all years of diſcretion, tho they are of beauty, ſhould never ſtrive for impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:38135:80"/>for youth will aſſoon come to the aged, as beauty to the ugly; but ſince beauty will not come to content you, be you content with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and ſtrive for that you may obtain, which is <hi>the beauty of holineſs,</hi> which infinitely excels all others, it being much better to live well, than look ſo, and to have a good ſoul, than a fine face, that being earthly and ever fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but a pure ſoul is heavenly, and never decays being everlaſting.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, that Man who is ſo ſimple to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Age for meer Mony, when that's ſpent, (and you know that Mony, like Love, cannot always laſt) all the uſe of conſolation I can think of, is to ſend for a Miniſter to give him ſome ſpiritual advice, of which he may perchance receive ſome to eaſe the trouble of his mind, but as to the bodily diſtemper or plague of his broken infirmity I am ſure there can be no remedy, but that of death; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it may be fitly ſaid, of a young Mans Marrying an old ugly Woman, what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaid of a greater folly in another ſenſe, <hi>be that doth ſo, offends againſt his own body,</hi> and truly ſuch a one hath in my opinion, no other plea left him to excuſe his folly, than <hi>Adam</hi> had to excuſe his firſt Sin, <hi>The Woman beguiled me;</hi> I ſay in Caſes like this poſſibly S. <hi>Paul</hi> might have thought it equal, for ſo indeed it is, things rightly conſidered, for ſuch men to ſuffer, or rather indeed conquer the diſturbance
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:38135:81"/>of a luſtful burning, than endure the plague, and continual miſery of an ill old ugly Wife, that can neither pleaſe the fancy, nor ſatisfie the appetite, and therefore coming to ſuch a ſad Marriage, is like coming to the age of fourſcore, after which experience tells us, there's only Labour, Infirmity, and Sorrow, young Husbands, and old Wives, being but meer names, things of form, not uſe, only made to torment one another, Living in one Houſe, but Lying in two Beds, for the old Wife would have what the young Husband will not give, and the old Wife cannot give what the young Husband would have; in ſhort a bad Wife at Land, is like a Storm at Sea, which becauſe a Man is ſo unhappy to be engaged in, and cannot be rid of it, muſt be ſuffer'd out with patience.</p>
               <p>And ſo I have done with old Wives, for I am certain the Reader muſt be weary of them, as well as I am ſure the Writer is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will leave this extream of old Age, and treat on that of young beauty, and the folly of them, that Marry meerly for it, and here ſet you down in a few Lines, the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, uſual acceſſes, and woful events, of ſuch hot, raſh, haſty, meer beauty Marriages, as are now in faſhion among many of our young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, who chooſe Wives as the ſilly <hi>Indians</hi> do our Merchants Tynſel and Bawbles, who value their real worth only by their glittering ſhow.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:38135:81"/>
               <p>The firſt ſteps and degrees of a young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants growing love and fancy to his Miſtris are generally theſe; firſt he likes the Woman as we ſay in a Lump, or by whole-ſale, then he admires her beauties apart, courts her perſon, loves her humor, thinks all ſhe ſays is witty, and all ſhe does is graceful and becoming, and all her actions agreeable and excellent, though poſſibly not one of them are ſo; for you muſt know that beauty in Love, is like Charity in Religion, <hi>it covereth a multitude of faults.</hi> Then he preſents his heart, and ſhe becomes the ſole Miſtris of it, and as his paſſion increaſes, ſo he fancies her beauty does, till at laſt he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the ſcorching flames of her beauty, to be more inſupportable than a Midſummers Sun, in its full meridian heat and ſtrength; and therefore reſolves to follow S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice, <hi>'Tis better to Marry than Burn;</hi> but then pray take this Caution with you, <hi>that tho of two evils, 'tis beſt to chooſe the leaſt,</hi> yet that argues neither to be good, (as indeed it was not, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> firſt ſpoke thoſe words,) and in ſome ſenſe may not be ſo now, yet however our fierce Lovers heart being all a fire, his mind thereby grows reſtleſs, and as very much out of order as his reaſon, (if a Man in Love has any,) for to ſay a paſſionate Lover that has loſt his heart, and can yet keep his reaſon, is the greateſt of follies, next to that of being ſo in Love.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:38135:82"/>
               <p>But ſince our Amorous Gallant is ſo furiouſly ſmitten, rather than not quench the Amorous ſcorching flames of his luſtful paſſion, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving not to admit him to her Bed, in any other ſhape, than that of a Husband, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding at all in his Vows of ſpeedily Marrying her, poſſibly becauſe ſhe had tried anothers word before, and he broke it, and deceiv'd her, and therefore ſhe reſolv'd not to be cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo a ſecond time, by a ſecond Tryal; our hot Politick Lover, to enjoy the momentary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of embracing her beauty, does with much deſperatneſs, and little conſideration, caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down that dangerous Precipice of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and long-liv'd trouble of a Wife, tho he buy her at the deareſt rate of Purchaſing, and it may be worſe ſort of ſooling an ill Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, a very ſad bottom to Inſure the content and happineſs of a Mans life upon, ſince he who only Trades to get the Merchandiſe of beauty, may become a ſad looſer tho he gets his whole Adventure, ſince ſuch a ſort of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony does uſually bring the Husband, and often the Wife, Springs of miſery and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, but ſeldom ſo much as any drops of the Oyl of pure gladneſs, and true ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>And indeed one of the great reaſons why Men that Marry for mere beauty, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo unhappy in their Choice, is, That as their Miſtriſſes beauty is but a mixture of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:38135:82"/>flaſhy and glaring colours, ſo is in a manner their reaſon; for not conſidering, that beauty Love, is but like Gunpowder, which as it flames at the firſt Spark; ſo it ſets forth all its ſtrength and fierceneſs at its firſt firing, and then ſoon expires into meer ſmoak and air.</p>
               <p>The firſt falling in Love of an amorous Man, being juſt like the firſt ſurprize of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in a Cholerick Perſon, it runs on ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it ſtays not to attend reaſon, nor conſult diſcretion or conveniency, and ſo ſtrips it ſelf of true underſtanding, and therefore aſſoon as ſuch a Husband has cloy'd his ſenſual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, on that ſurfeiting Diſh of a meer beauty Marriage, his ſtomack being uſed to feaſt on ſweet variety, longs for other food, and then firſt Love grows indifferent, his paſſion ſoon cools, his eager fiery fancy grows quickly dull, and his mind ſuddenly changes; ſo that he preſently forms a new deſire, or paſſion of love, and loaths his former beauty Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the moſt irkſom deformity; and ſhe whom he was ſo lately fond of, as the moſt pleaſing Charm and Converſe of his life, who was a kind of <hi>Elixir ſalutis</hi> to his very heart and ſoul, and the Center point where all the Lines of his happineſs did meet; She in whom he could find no diſcontent with, or content without; She whoſe preſence made a Village as agreeable as <hi>London,</hi> and her abſence <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> as doleful as a Village. In ſhort this very
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:38135:83"/>She, whoſe Company he eſteem'd his Heaven upon Earth; no ſooner was the flower of her fair and youthful beauty worn off, but his fickle paſſion aſſoon decays and grows languid, and this late Soul of his ſoul, and Joy of his heart, turns to be the very clog and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his life, and from all Miſtris, becomes all Wife; that is, ſhe falls from the top of all admiration, to the depth of meer miſery, and from an extraordinary charming delight, to an ordinary neceſſary evil, called a Wife.</p>
               <p>And ſuch Husbands commonly call ſuch Wives, and ſo do Wives ſuch Husbands, the Yoaks of Liberty, and the Stocks of Love; and all know that neither of them can be eaſie or pleaſing in ſuch a bondage, being an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and deſtroyer of ſweet variety, ſo that the Husbands love being decay'd with his Wives beauty, he grows weary of her, ſhe of him, and both of one another.</p>
               <p>And as to a young Mans Marrying an old ugly Wife, meerly for her Mony, all I ſhall need ſay of it is, that often ſuch young Men fancy ſuch Mony Wives, to be of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mony it ſelf, whoſe vertue conſiſts not in keeping of it, but in parting with it, and ſo commonly uſe ſuch Wives accordingly; and thus this wild paſſionate Love or meer Mony Marriages, like wild-fire, ſoon devours and conſumes it ſelf in its own flame; and Torrent like, inſtead of refreſhing, it deſtroys, and by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:38135:83"/>over-preſſing too violently the courſe and ſtreams of its Waters, ſoon Ebbs and runs it ſelf dry.</p>
               <p>Therefore that Man that will ſell his ſweet Liberty, and enſlave himſelf into Matrimonial Chains, meerly to enjoy a Womans beauty; ſure he does not know, or at leaſt does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that ſtill the richer the Metal, the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Chain, and therefore though his Miſtris be never ſo much the admired object of his preſent fancy, and that I ſhould allow her golden Chains to weigh as long light on his mind, as ſhe continues beautiful to his ſight, yet to bind himſelf to herin a Matrimonial Vow on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the account of her beauty, till death them depart, on aſſurance that he ſhall feaſt on her beauty as long as he lives, is juſt ſuch a kind of folly, as if a young Man that were a great Lover of Sweet meats, ſhould leave all his buſineſs, imployments, and paſtimes to bind himſelf an Apprentice for ſeven Years to a Confectioner, meerly on the account, and aſſurance, that during that time he ſhould eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day feaſt himſelf on them, when very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Experience is able to inform him, though his confidence be never ſo great, his inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons never ſo eager, and his ſtomach never ſo good, yet 'tis natural for him to eat ſo fiercely at firſt falling on, that like a greedy <hi>Howk,</hi> he ſoon over-gorges himſelf with his own Prey; and after having taken a full draught of that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:38135:84"/>ſenſual delight, ſeeing them continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to his ſight, and proſtrate to his will, he comes to hate them as much after enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he courted them before; for though the Fire of Love ſtill burns for enjoyment, yet enjoyment ſtill quenches, (if not extinguiſhes) the fire of Love, and he grows in a little time ſo cloy'd, as he wants not only appetite to eat them, but almoſt patience to ſee them.</p>
               <p>Then when tis too late, he accuſes the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of his prefancied delight, on which he built his confidence of a laſting plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and allows it to be not only a great folly, but ſin againſt reaſon, in any Man to believe, that his ſenſitive nature ought to be gratified, when it propoſes only a bare ſatisfaction to the Appetite, and cannot ſecure any durable hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or content to the reaſon and judgment of mankind.</p>
               <p>And this is really the cauſe, why ſo many of our young Gallants now adays make Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage a kind of Paradox in Love; for one of theſe to obtain the Woman he is in Love with, turns his Miſtris into a Wife, and then tis two to one, in a little time, to get rid of his late beautiful Miſtris, being ſhrunk into the ſhape of a meer Domeſtick Wife, he parts for ever with his late Miſtris, to get free from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Wife; and note that tho many Miſtriſſes turn to Wives, yet no Wives ever turn to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſſes; Wife and Miſtris being of the ſame dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:38135:84"/>nature as Water and Wine, 'tis common to drink Wine with Water, but of Water to make Wine to Drink, was never done but once, and that by the firſt Miracle of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; ſo that in effect they did but ſee ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree, really to fall out, piece together, to fall aſunder, and Married to get rid of one anothers Company.</p>
               <p>And 'tis ſome of theſe unfortunate diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Husbands that ſays the Tranſlator of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, hath left out the word, <hi>well,</hi> in one of them; for where the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>He that gives in Marriage does well,</hi> it ſhould have been, <hi>He that gives well in Marriage does well,</hi> for all know there are more bad Wives, than good; and ſure all believe, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was too wiſe to write or think, that any Man could do well in Marrying ill; ſo that I am of opinion, the ſum of the Apoſtles meaning by ſaying, He <hi>that Marries well does well, but he that abſtains from Marriage does better,</hi> has ſome reference to that good plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſaying, <hi>That next to no Wife, a good Wife is beſt,</hi> which occaſions my pitying the many Husbands that have bad Wives, and the many Wives that have ill Husbands, and to wiſh thoſe few, that fancy they have good ones, as truly content in their Marriages, as I am in my Reſolution of never Marrying; and I am ſure none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that I have this advantage by the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that 'tis impoſſible for me to meet a bad
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:38135:85"/>Wife that does not Marry, but 'tis very poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and common for him that does.</p>

                  <hi>THE EIGHTH DISCOURSE,</hi> Againſt Maids Marrying for meer Love, or only to pleaſe their Parents Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, tho' quite contrary to their own.</head>
               <p>I Am againſt Maids Marrying for meer Love; becauſe they that Marry for meer Love, Marry in a manner for meer fancy, and ſo to feaſt their ſenſual appetite on what they then like, they often ſtarve the body of what it will hereafter need; for tho' your fancy may tell you that beauty great ſtore makes Love a feaſt, yet truth can tell you 'tis too ſlender a Diet to make a livelyhood on; therefore in my poor opinion, 'twould be a much wiſer courſe for Maids to make up their Marriages with a good ſhare, and large proportion of intereſt and conveniency, to mix with their Love-liking, and preſent fancy, for the true and durable content of Marriages is ſo founded on theſe two great Pillars, that without them Marriage-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent can never flouriſh much or laſt long; for a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:38135:85"/>good ſufficient Eſtate of Land is as neceſſary to buy rich Clothes, and maintain a handſom plentiful way of Living, as the Foundation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ground, is to ſupport the fine Rooms above it.</p>
               <p>Beauty is a fine Flower, but it muſt ſoon fade, and a young Womans Love fancy, may often change, but can never long hold, but a good Eſtate may continue longer than you can love or live, and laſt after you are dead, to your Childrens Children to the worlds end; but a meer naked Love-match, is at very moſt, but a Tenant for Life, and uſually not near ſo long; a good Eſtate can keep you in ſickneſs, and in health; but a Love faſtned on meer beauty or fancy, never can, for ſuch a fancy-Love ſtill fadeth away with the beauty that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions it, ſince aſſoon as the flower of beauty begins to wither at the top, the admirers Love begins to die at the root.</p>
               <p>Yet indeed I cannot think it very ſtrange, that young Maids ſhould be deluded with the delightful thoughts of pleaſing and ſatisfying their preſent beloved fancy, of enjoying the Perſon of their inclinations, ſince in moſt young Maids, their fancy, makes their Reaſon, and not their Reaſon governs their Fancy, and therefore 'tis not to be wonder'd that they ſhould eſteem it reaſonable, that there is great happineſs, and that there will be long content, in ſuch meer and bare love Marriages, becauſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:38135:86"/>they never tried the ſad experiment of ſuch a raſh haſty Marriage, and therefore their want of experience, may well ſerve for ſome kind of excuſe, to moderate their want of Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but after a dear bought Tryal, too many of them find by woful experience, that a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Love built on bare beauty, or meer fancy, (which are much alike) can never ſtem the Tyde of the troubles of diſappointments, and inconveniences, (the uſual Iſſue of want,) that commonly attend ſuch hot and haſty Love-Marriages, ſince they cannot fancy ſo well of it, as they will find ill in it, yet there's ſo great a Charm in this thing call'd a Husband, Maids repreſenting the Man as they would have him, without conſidering what he really is, as poor ſilly Maids dance about him as merrily, as they do a <hi>Maypole</hi> on a Summers day, and one Siſters ſad and unhappy Marriage will not ſerve the other for a Caution and Warning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, becauſe ſhe fancies her wit is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, her humor better, her beauty greater, and her perſon more taking, ſo eaſily young Maids believe what they deſire, and therefore doubts not, but her Fate will be kinder, and her Husband better, than her Siſters; but 'tis more than an even Lay, ſhe will ſoon after her Marriage, experimentally find, ſhe had more faith in believing her good fortune, than ſhe had reaſon for depending on it, ſince ſhe had on that account more danger to fear, than
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:38135:86"/>happineſs to hope for, or at leaſt to rely on.</p>
               <p>Thus ſuch Marriages, are to moſt young Maids, like the forbidden Tree in the midſt of Paradiſe, pleaſant to the Amorous Eye, and therefore they will be taſting of it, tho they are almoſt ſure to be ever after miſerable by it, by their abandoning, and ever after loſing their great Virgin prerogative, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribes them, of being exempt from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of pleaſing their Husbands, and being in ſubjection to them.</p>
               <p>And ſure none that's Maſter of common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, can deny but a Virgins life is much happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, becauſe more innocent than any other, and as 'tis much nearer the bleſſed ſtate of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in this World, ſo alſo 'tis much more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure as to the felicity of the next, eſpecially in this one particular, That 'tis much eaſier for a Virgin to keep her ſelf vertuouſly Chaſt, than either a Married Woman, or Widow; becauſe both natural reaſon, and common experience teaches us this plain Philoſophy, that 'tis much harder to abſtain from a pleaſure one has often taſted, than 'tis to live without a delight one has never enjoy'd, it being ſuch a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as none can deny, that 'tis leſs difficult to keep ripe Fruit that's fair and ſound, and was never touch'd, than 'tis to keep any ſuch after they have been ſo.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:38135:87"/>
               <p>Therefore in a word, you Virgins that are ſo much in the State of happy freedom, as not to be yoak'd in ſuch a ſort of Marriage, and to the pinching troubles of want, (for fancy can only feed the mind, not the body) and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the ſottiſh humors and impertinent fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of a jealous Husband, for want is apt ſtill to create jealouſie. I ſay if you Virgins truly deſire to continue in your freedom and happy Life, never allow Men to become your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, by ſwearing they are your humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and by calling you their Queens, make you their Subjects, for by Marriage you make your Servant your Maſter, and from being Miſtris of your ſelf, you become little better than a Slave to your Husband.</p>
               <p>Therefore as an Antidote againſt this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I ſhall adviſe all young Virgins to carry ſtill this <hi>Memorandum</hi> in their minds, That tho beauty is ſtill taking, yet 'tis never laſting; ſweet, but frail, and that all Husbands love Sovereignty much, but few own beauty long, eſpecially in the domeſtick face of a Wife.</p>
               <p>And becauſe 'tis great pity theſe ſort of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Marrying Maids, ſhould have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to ſolace them in their fad penitential ſtate of Mourning, give me leave to introduce ſome Married Women into their diſmal Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for as many Maids make themſelves miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by Marrying for meer Love, ſo many are alſo made unfortunate in Marrying meerly to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:38135:87"/>pleaſe their Parents, not at all to ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for really moſt Parents make it more their concern to match Fortunes than Children, or to ſuit inclinations or ages, when 'tis but a kind of Reverſing Nature it ſelf, it being as feaſible to unite two contraries, and make Fire and Water agree, and <hi>May</hi> and <hi>January</hi> meet, as by the Magick of Matrimony to make a very old Man, and a very young Woman to be but one fleſh and temper; for youthful beauty to the mind, is as cold old Age to the body; Heat penitrates the pores of the body eaſily, becauſe they expatiate themſelves to receive it, but when Cold approaches and attacks it, preſently it cloſes, as being contrary and averſe to it.</p>
               <p>Yet many Parents think to deal with their Childrens Marriages, as they do with their Fruit-Trees, and think they can Graft humors and inclinations between Husband and Wife, as they Graft different kinds of Fruits on one another, and by their Grafting and binding them together, they make their differing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to become but one by Marriage, but upon ſerious Conſideration, which does not always attend Marriage; they will ſoon find, that the Miniſter can only joyn their hands, but 'tis the free-will offering of the heart, that can only unite and Graft their affections together, and this free-will offering is to be led by Love, not drawn by the Cords of Wedlock, for the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:38135:88"/>Will is a free faculty, and conſequently can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be forcibly determined to any act, but yet is capable of admitting perſwaſions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, and ſo may be by them inclin'd, but without them cannot be forced.</p>
               <p>And therefore tho Maids ought not to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry without their Parents conſent, yet they ought not to be compell'd againſt their own; 'Tis true indeed that large Eſtates can produce a plenty of Livelyhood, but 'tis as true, that Content only can produce happy Living, for Content and Riches prove often to be no a kin to one another; but Content and Happineſs are Twins, and ever inſeparable friends, and like Water and Ice, one ſtill makes the other.</p>
               <p>Content is certainly the greateſt worldly happineſs, for it makes the poor Rich with it, and the Rich poor without it, and very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience tells us that many poor Men are made happy by their unrich Wives, and many wealthy heireſſes are made miſerable and unfortunate by their rich Husbands, for 'tis not much but enough that ſatisfies, and the Weekly Bills of Mortality inform us, that more die with Surfeits, than ſtarve with Hunger, the true Meaſures of Contentment not conſiſting in quantity, but quality, for many have much that have not enough, and many have enough that have not much; ſome young Women being compoſed of ſuch diſtempered Hidropick fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh humors, as there's no quenching the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:38135:88"/>Thirſt of their hot ambitious deſires; others are ſo temperately minded, and healthfully wiſe, as a moderate and indifferent kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſatisfies them, and thoſe are happy in ſuch a moderation to a high degree; Content being the Throne of happineſs, the very top of our ambition, and the end and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all our deſires, the ſole want of which, is like that of wanting health, which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to unpleaſure all our other enjoyments, in a word, Content is of ſuch an obliging generous Nature, and of ſo univerſal value, as it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth us with every thing, that either our real neceſſity wants, or our vain deſires fancy.</p>
               <p>And as Content is thus pleaſing, ſo diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is little leſs unpleaſing, and therefore I cannot but highly blame and Cenſure ſuch Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranical ill natur'd Parents, as becauſe they like ſuch a Mans fortune, therefore they will make their Child Marry ſuch a ones perſon, tho 'tis as odious to her ſight, as pleaſing to her fathers Covetous humor, and ſo to ſatisfie his will, muſt force her inclinations to Marry him, tho utterly againſt her own. Indeed 'tis ſuch kind of forc'd Marriages that drives young Women into a double evil, and that of the worſt ſort too, being thoſe of Perjury, and Treachery; for how can you make it leſs than Perjury, in a young Woman, to make a ſolemn Vow in the face of the Congregation to Love that Man her whole Life, whom ſhe knows ſhe cannot Love
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:38135:89"/>a piece of a day, nay not ſo much as that very time of her Life, ſhe is vowing to Love him, till death them depart.</p>
               <p>And ſurely there is no leſs Treachery in ſuch a Marriage Vow, that muſt be a kin to that black one of <hi>Judas, who under pretence to kiſs his Lord and Maſter, brought a band of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to ſeize him,</hi> ſo averſe forced Marriages under pretence of long continuing friendſhip and kindneſs, by ſhaking hands, but not joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hearts, do often bring Bands of diſcontents and miſeries to each others Lives, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>Therefore to conclude this Diſcourſe, my opinion is that Parents may chooſe their Daughters wealthy Husbands to live with, but 'tis only themſelves that can chuſe Husbands to be delighted in, and therefore thoſe Maids do well that Marry with their Parents liking, and they do ill, that Marry againſt their own.</p>

               <head>THE NINTH DISCOURSE, <hi>Againſt Widows Marrying.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHen I conſider truly, and reflect ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onſly, how many Widows have made themſelves miſerable by Marriage, and how few make themſelves happy by Marrying, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it ſhould be now as needleſs a Task to diſſwade ſuch from Marrying as to adviſe them not to eat again of that Diſh they came juſt from ſurfeiting on; for ſure ſhe that makes her ſelf unhappy by a ſecond Marriage, deſerves as much her own miſery, and merits as little others pity, as the Man that ſteals again after having been burn in the hand, does the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: for a repeated fault is a twofold Crime, and deferves a double puniſhment.</p>
               <p>I know I need not mind the Reader of the old and common fable, of two Women that went aſſoon as they died, to S. <hi>Peter</hi> to get ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> the firſt aſſured him, that her Husband was ſuch a deviliſh wicked ill natured Man, that he made her life a kind of Hell on Earth, upon which account S. <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:38135:90"/>thought it reaſonable, that ſince ſhe had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd a Hell in this World, ſhe ſhould not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure another in the next, and ſo admitted her into <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Woman obſerving this, thought ſhe had a double Key and Ticket, for ſhe was not only tormented with one, but two bad wicked croſs-grain'd Husbands, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd her life moſt miſerable: but S. <hi>Peter</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd her, that ſince ſhe was ſo very ſimple as not to think one bad Husband enough, but ſhe muſt have two, he bid her be gone, for <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi> was no place for fools; indeed that Widow muſt be extravagantly fooliſh, and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that did not think the miſery of one baſe Husband ſufficient, but ſhe muſt try the experiment of a ſecond.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, I cannot at all agree in opinion with that Writer who ſays, a woman is but an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Creature whilſt ſhe is without a Husband; but had he ſaid a Widow was not come to her full perfection of miſery 'till ſhe had one; I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he had given a truer Character, and taken a more juſt meaſure of moſt Widows lives that Marry, ſince common experience may aſſure all Wives and Widows, that there are generally ten bad Husbands for one good one, and I believe there are few Widows in our age, that are ſo perfect Diſciples of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s wiſdom, as to extract ſatisfaction out of miſery, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Apoſtolical vertue to be ſatisfied, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:38135:90"/>contented in, whatſoever condition it pleaſeth God to place one to.</p>
               <p>But I am rather of the belief, that a young beautiful Widow, that leads a ſtrict vertuous unmarried life, leads a kind of Miraculous one, in as much as ſhe being born a Subject to the Law of Nature, and to the Luſtful frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it, having not only taſted, but probably delighted in them, and yet can contain her ſelf ſo in the bounds of ſuch a vertue and pious Mortification, as to be ſo much Miſtris of her ſelf, and of her own youthful temper, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, as to reſiſt the preſſing temptations of young handſom Men with an unmoveable vertuous conſtancy; ſuch young Widows do really live in this world, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay the <hi>Nuns</hi> do in their <hi>Nunneries, That they live in the fleſh, as if they had no bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſure ſince it cannot be denied, but a vertue that overcomes the higheſt difficulties, fierceſt inclinations, and moſt youthful paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, muſt needs excel all others; then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in the leaſt doubted, but that a young handſom Widow that leads a retir'd, ſtrict and unmarried life, muſt needs in that kind ſurpaſs all other Women, becauſe ſhe practiſes more the vertue of continence than any of them can, I mean as to the outward mark of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſince a Widow that lives in a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to ſuch a ſtrict pious life reſembles moſt, and approaches cloſeſt to the heavenly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:38135:91"/>one, which muſt needs be the beſt as coming neareſt to perfection, for ſhe declines the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural commerce of the body, to enjoy the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Spiritual Contemplation of the Soul. And 'tis moſt certain the more Women keep their thoughts and deſires from worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and vanities, the more their minds will be fortified againſt them, and the more ready they'll be to embrace true felicity.</p>
               <p>We read in Scripture that the Womans ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Man, was laid on her as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and puniſhment for her diſobedience to her God. Truly moſt of the young Married Sparks of our Age, are very active in obſerving Gods pleaſure herein, yet not at all on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Almighty's deſign, but the worlds practice, which is for ſuch Sparks to make Marriage a puniſhment to the Woman, as much as they can, that is as much as ſome Wives will; for <hi>ſerve, honour,</hi> and <hi>obey,</hi> are grown but words of courſe, which all Women muſt repeat after the Miniſter at Marriage, but few will perform after they are Married, and their promiſe of obedience till death them do part, is ſeldom in their thoughts as long as they live.</p>
               <p>Indeed I have known ſome young handſom Widows, who have lov'd their own Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and their Husbands Memory, ſo much as to continue ſome years in a ſtrict deep Mourning, as well in their Life as Dreſs. And I have alſo known other Widows, of the wild
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:38135:91"/>brisk <hi>London</hi> brood, that have not ſo much Complemented their Husbands death, as to hold out one year a Widows Life, tho contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Cuſtom of the Country, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rules of decency and civility.</p>
               <p>And as ſhewing ſo little a concern for a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is very unbecoming, and highly immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, not to ſpeak worſe; ſo on the other hand overmuch grief and deſpair, are both impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and irreligious.</p>
               <p>But I need not ſpeak much of this overabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Mourning for a Husband, ſince 'tis a diſtemper of mind, very few Widows of our age are inclin'd too, and therefore not in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being infected with; for moſt Widows can tell us that they are ſo well read in the brave <hi>Roman</hi> Story, who though they had no other bounds to their aſpiring hopes, than the Conqueſt of the whole world, yet they ſtill pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their glory and praiſe, as much in ſuffering well, as in doing ſo, ſaying, <hi>as they ought not to be overmuch exalted by proſperity, ſo they ought not to be too much depreſſed or caſt down by adverſity,</hi> but to obſerve <hi>the Golden Rule</hi> of Mediocrity in both Caſes, and therefore 'tis not ill Wife like, but brave <hi>Roman</hi> like, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all loſſes with Courage and Patience.</p>
               <p>And 'tis from theſe Conſiderations that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our fine young gay brisk Widows ſay, <hi>They eſteem more the Phyloſophers Wit, than his Wiſdom,</hi> who being in great affliction, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:38135:92"/>weeping moſt bitterly for the death of his Wife, one of his friends told him, his crying, could do neither him, nor her any good; Therefore ſaid the Philoſopher I Cry.</p>
               <p>But this is a kind of doleful Logick, that ſuits ill with the ſprightly gaiety of our fine young Widows, and therefore it muſt be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as well as troubleſom to mind them of it, it being a very unmodiſh doctrin, to preach to ſuch young Widows, that becauſe their Husbands are out of the world, therefore they ought to live as if they were not in it, and bury themſelves alive in a ſtrict ſolitary retirement, which they will tell you ſavours more of great folly, than true wiſdom; ſince no Woman by her Matrimonial Vow, is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Love her Husband longer than till death them do part; and indeed as Wives now go, I think 'tis very extraordinary to meet one that truly loves her Husband half ſo long. In a word, ſhe that gives her Husband a more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Love than ſhe promiſed, is generouſly kind, but ſhe that pays him as much as ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for, is truly juſt.</p>
               <p>Next 'tis moſt certain that all extreams are bad, and therefore Widows ought to avoid them on both ſides; either by ſhewing too little a Concern, or too violent a Grief, for their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands death; I know I need not travel your thoughts ſo far as the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> to ſhew you the barbarous examples of Womens love to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:38135:92"/>their dead Husbands bodies, by ſacrificing themſelves to the Devil, by burning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alive, ſoon after their Husbands death; we have examples enough in the Hiſtory of our Neighbouring Princes, of their Wives bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Cruelty committed againſt their own Lives, for their Husbands loſs of theirs; (but then do not miſtake me, ſo as to think, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are any ſuch kind of fond fooliſh Wives in our age,) as <hi>Adymond</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweedland,</hi> who, when ſhe heard her Husband was kill'd by the <hi>Danes,</hi> ſaid ſhe would ſoon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and preſently ſtabb'd her ſelf. I might name you many more of this bloody Nature, but ſurely ſuch kind of Tragical examples are to be look'd upon, but as the vile and wicked effects of madneſs or a deviliſh deſpair, and not at all the motions of a pious vertuous love, ſince good Wives may ſhew their kindneſs, without ſhedding their blood, and may mourn heartily, without dying Cruelly; for ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural deaths utterly deſtroy that great Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian vertue, of well regulating their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>And certainly no Widow ſtands more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to her Husbands memory, either by the Laws of outward Civility and good manners, or by the inward effects of true love and real eſteem, than to obſerve thoſe kinds of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and degrees of mourning for their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, which are uſual according to the rules
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:38135:93"/>of cuſtom and decency, which is to live a ſtrict religious and unmarried life, for ſome conſiderable time, or longer as ſome Women do; and among thoſe many who continue ſo to the end of their days, and ſo are Widows indeed according to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> phraſe, and ſo deſerve his character of honour. And among thoſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit a juſt commendation of the three moſt Excellent vertuous Ladies, and kind Siſters, who live together near <hi>London,</hi> I need not name them, becauſe I am ſure, there are not three Widow Siſters of their high Quality, great Vertue, and clear Reputation, that live together in all <hi>England;</hi> for which as they have the juſt admiration and praiſes of all true Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Vertue; ſo I wiſh all Widows would ſtrive to imitate their religious example, that ſo like them, they might enjoy comfort of true devotion and felicity upon earth, as an earneſt of more bleſſed comforts and happineſs they do expect in the other World.</p>
               <p>And who by leading ſuch a conſtant religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and unmarried Life, the world muſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, that ſuch Widows have no particular fondneſs for any Man in the world, ſince their dear Husbands are out of it, and that they do ſtill ſhew a conſtant affection, real eſteem and memory of their Husbands vertues and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and by a particular kindneſs continued to all their Husbands Relations and Friends, as much as if they had been now actually living,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:38135:93"/>and could be made ſenſible of the effects of their good or ill nature towards them. I ſay ſuch a vertuous and diſcreet carriage in Widows is a moſt clear demonſtration that Loves do not expire with their Husbands Lives; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuch an affection muſt be more real, and leſs by aſſed, as to all appearances, than the love of any living Wife can poſſible be; ſince that may only look counterfeit, and be diſguiſed, by wearing a Mask of ſelf-intereſt, or deſign rather than of true affection or value, and may be reckoned on the account, of living in good eſteem or reputation as to the world, or be counterfeited for an outward ſeeming kindneſs to her Husband, tho ſhe has no real inward one, in order to live at peace and quiet at home, both for her Childrens good, and for her own and families eaſe.</p>
               <p>But a Widow that continues (as I have ſaid) conſonant kindneſs to her Husbands me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and Relations, and lives in the ſtate of a private and religious widowhood; ſuch a one can expect no return, or hope for any praiſe or advantage, but from the juſt commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her vertue while ſhe lives, or indeed the more certain comfort and aſſurance of her eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, when ſhe comes to die.</p>
               <p>But mortifying Diſcourſes of this nature, I am ſure muſt be far from making any agreeable muſick to the fine young Widows, but it may be ſound harſh, and unpleaſant, as well as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:38135:94"/>uſeleſs and unliking; many of the fine gay young Widows, making the day of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands death, the joyful Birthday of their own freedom.</p>
               <p>And there are few of theſe brisk witty ſort of <hi>Widows</hi> that are not ſo great <hi>Philoſophers</hi> in the Politicks of Marriage, and ſo perfectly read in all parts of <hi>Scripture</hi> tending to that point, as to be wiſely able to extract out of it, the vertue of <hi>Patience,</hi> and to poſſeſs it in ſo high a degree, and great meaſure, as to be able to raiſe to themſelves ſatisfactory Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of all ſizes, degrees, and qualities what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to arm themſelves againſt the loſs of a Husband of any kind; be he good or bad, poor or rich, ſo as to render his death at leaſt eaſie, if not pleaſing, by arguing and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with themſelves after this manner:</p>
               <p>If my Husband was good and vertuous, and made a holy end, ſuitable to his religious life, ſure I ought not to mourn for it, but rejoyce at it, that he is gone to Heaven, and that I have in a manner half my ſelf there before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand; and therefore it muſt argue want of Charity, kindneſs and good nature to lament and mourn for his happineſs, in living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo well.</p>
               <p>If my Husband was wicked, lewd, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, I have a double reaſon to rejoyce for his death; firſt, that the world is rid of ſo bad a Man, and I of ſo ill a Husband, and am
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:38135:94"/>no more oblig'd to lie every night, with ſo much wickedneſs in my boſom, and that we are now no more one fleſh, who were ſo far from being of one mind, and humor; and I have alſo this ſecond means of extracting this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly advantage by it, that having experiment<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed the ſlaviſh miſery of ſerving the Creature, I am now, or at leaſt ought to be, the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and willing to dedicate all my remnant of Life, only to the ſervice of my Creator, whoſe ſervice is ſtill perfect freedom, and everlaſting felicity.</p>
               <p>If my Husband was poor and needy, I have reaſon to be glad he is intirely delivered from the great miſery of want, and that his poverty is dead and buried with him, for none ever feels want in the Grave.</p>
               <p>But if my Husband died Rich, I have great reaſon to rejoyce that he has left me ſo, and has given me by his death, what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied me all his life, the incontroulable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Wealth; and that I have now the range of the whole Kingdom, to ramble over, and ſpend it after what kind of manner, and with what ſort of Company, as I fancy moſt, and love beſt; and by being a Widow I am become the perfect Empreſs of my own Will, inſtead of being confin'd at home a Subject to my Husbands, and ſure none can reliſh with more guſto, the eaſe and liberty, and the many pleaſures of freedom, than ſhe that's newly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:38135:95"/>deliver'd from the bondage of a Marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and therefore what <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid of Vertue, <hi>that there's no Paſſion, or Affliction in the World, that Vertue has not a Remedy for:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid in reference to moſt young Widows love to their Husbands, let their paſſionate kindneſs for them be ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly never ſo great, whilſt they live, yet they will be ſure to find Remedies for their overmuch mourning for their death.</p>
               <p>And therefore I ſhall adviſe Husbands never to Antidate their trouble, by fearing that their death will produce a long ſadneſs in their Wives, at the common rate Marriage-Love now goes, there's no great fear of it; ſince in moſt Wives their good Jointure-Rents, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh their Love-ſighs, or at leaſt Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe all their formal Mourning; for there is really, ſo little pure Love in many of our Marriages now adays, as Husband and Wifes Love, is but of the ſame nature of that of great Sovereign Princes, whoſe Love is but meer Intereſt; and a Husbands death to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Wives, is become as Repentance for Sin, which cannot come ſo ſoon or late, but it ſtill brings Comfort with it.</p>
               <p>And now leſt you may take my ſpeaking againſt Widows Marrying, to be but a kind of raillying Diſcourſe, fit only to entertain, but not to convince; and that my reaſons againſt Widows Marrying are but meer Romantick,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:38135:95"/>pleaſant to be read, but needleſs to be believ'd; I will wave my own weak reaſonings, and quote you ſome <hi>Scripture</hi> ones, that ſeem not to favour Widows Marrying, but rather the contrary, to continue as they are, and for their encouragement to it, propounds to them great advantages by it, which are theſe, The firſt is out of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> Lev. 22.13. <hi>If a Prieſts Daughter be Married, ſhe muſt not eat of the Offerings of holy Things, but if the Prieſts Daughter be a Widow, ſhe may eat as in her Youth,</hi> that is, <hi>as if ſhe had been never Married and was a Maid, which was a priviledge Women had by living Widows under the Moſaick Law, and which would not have it ſeems been granted, had ſhe been made unclean by a ſecond Marriage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the happineſs and advantages Virgins have over Married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, gives this as one of his principal reaſons, that they live free and exempt from the cares of obſerving and pleaſing their Husbands, and being in ſubjection to them. And ſure Widows enjoy at leaſt as much, if not more, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count than Virgins can; for doubtleſs it muſt be a far greater degree of pleaſure, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to thoſe that have caſt off the Yoke of an ill Marriage, than it can be to thoſe that never wore it; as a ſick Man that recovers his health muſt needs enjoy more pleaſure by it, than another can in his health that was never ſick; and really in my opinion the Penance
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:38135:96"/>of an ill Marriage ought to be the beſt Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to make a Widow well ſavour the happineſs of an unmarried life, and the moſt perſwaſive Argument to make her continue ſo.</p>
               <p>I ſhall further obſerve, that the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> chap. 5. verſ. 5. Seems to divide Widows into two ſorts, the good, and the bad; the good he Characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with the Title of being <hi>Widows indeed,</hi> and gives us this ſign to know them by, <hi>She that truſteth in God, and continueth in Prayers, and Supplications night and day.</hi> This is the holy Mark, you may know a godly Widow by, and this is the Widow that the Apoſtle calls <hi>a Widow indeed,</hi> and orders <hi>Timothy</hi> to pay them great honour as ſuch.</p>
               <p>I am ſure theſe are not at all a kin to the race of proud brisk ranting Widows that are in, and about <hi>London,</hi> who abſtain not from Marriage upon the account of any retired reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Inclinations, or upon any want of deſires to Marry, (for moſt of theſe Widows deſire more Husbands than Husbands deſire them) for they only abſtain from Marriage becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get Husbands to ſuit their fancy, for they muſt Marry ſuch as are high enough to Match their Quality, Rich enough to maintain their Extravagancies, and fools enough to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by them; but ſuch a ſort of Abſtinence from Marriage, ſprings rather from great pride, than true devotion; and ſo proves rather a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:38135:96"/>Penance to their body, than proceeds from any principle of Vertue in their mind.</p>
               <p>The bad ſort of Widows the Apoſtle brands with the foul marks, <hi>of being not only idle, but tatlers and buſie-bodies wandring from Houſe to Houſe,</hi> which among the <hi>London Ladies</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Viſiting;</hi> theſe ſort of Widows S. <hi>Paul</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>Timothy</hi> to refuſe, and not to admit into the number, and ſeems to give this reaſon for it; for when <hi>a Widow waxeth wanton againſt Chriſt,</hi> that is againſt holineſs, <hi>ſhe will Marry,</hi> (where by the by, take notice Widows, that Marrying is a ſign of waxing wanton) and next, if that young Widows had not been naturally inclin'd to this ſort of wantonneſs, the Apoſtle would never have given this ſtrict charge about it, by ordering <hi>Timothy</hi> not to admit a Widow into the number under ſixty, the Wife of one Husband, not two, which in effect was to admit no Widow, but ſuch a one as reſolv'd never to Marry; for ſure the Apoſtle might very well conclude, that a Widow that did not Marry before ſixty, would never Marry after; it being an unfit and undecent Age, as exceeding all the bounds of gravity and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being an age altogether uncapable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer one of thoſe ends Marriage was chiefly ordained for, bringing Children into the world; for S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame Verſe, <hi>Where he will that young Women ſhould Marry, he orders them to bring Children.</hi> 1 Tim. 5.14. So that 'tis
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:38135:97"/>clear, that a Widow at ſixty ought not to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe a Widow at that Age cannot bring forth Children; and tho I confeſs a Widow at ſixty may with her great Wealth buy a young Husband, (for Gallants are ſtill to be had for Mony,) yet 'tis impoſſible that her years ſhould ever breed a Child; for though her Mony may bring her a Husband to Bed, yet all the Midwives in Chriſtendom can never bring her ſo.</p>
               <p>And now I have given you my opinion as to old Widows, I ſhall here preſent my advice to the young ones, which is, inſtead of ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on the great uncertainty of meeting a good Husband, you will diſpoſe your ſelves unto the ſervice of a good God, where you will be ſure to enjoy true content in this world, (which is more than you will be ſure to do in a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,) and eternal felicity in the next, in ſuch a perfect ſtate of bliſs, as you will have nothing to hope, or fear, wiſh, or deſire; for ſhe that has all ſhe deſires, can have nothing to wiſh.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>ſhe that liveth in pleaſure, is dead while ſhe liveth;</hi> therefore all Widows will do well to reflect ſeriouſly on the vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, of living in vanity, ſin, and pleaſure, and that of living vertuouſly, and in a true love, and holy fear of God; and ſo to be liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the bleſſed number of thoſe that S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Widows indeed, who continue in ſupplication and prayer, night and day.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:38135:97"/>
               <p>To conclude, this is the vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Widow that liveth in vain Pleaſure, and ſhe that liveth in the true fear of God; <hi>The one is dead whilſt ſhe liveth, and the other ſhall live eternally after ſhe is dead.</hi>

                  <hi>THE TENTH DISCOURSE,</hi> Againſt keeping of MISSES.</head>
               <p>NOW I have finiſhed my Diſcourſe on the unpleaſing Subject, of many Widows mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries by making ſecond Marriages; I ſhall change that doleful Scene, and now bring on the Stage the gay, brisk, modiſh vice of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Miſſes;</hi> a ſin grown ſo in faſhion, as the great cuſtom of the faſhion, has overgrown the ſenſe of the ſin; being a vice ſo common, as its commonneſs makes many forget 'tis a vice, nay ſome of your young Atheiſtical Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are ſo far from condemning the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, as they pretend to juſtifie its pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice as not ſinful; but for this ſort of <hi>Sataniſts,</hi> they are only fit to be ſhut up with a <hi>Red Croſs,</hi> and a <hi>Domine miſerere</hi> upon their Doors, that they may be branded ſo for the plague of their
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:38135:98"/>impiety, as to keep in their infection to themſelves, for theſe are ſteering directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wind, with a full ſail to Hell.</p>
               <p>There are another ſort, that ſteer almoſt the ſame courſe, but with a ſide wind; and tho' theſe are of very wicked principles, yet they are not of ſo profane and debauch'd a kind, as the former; for theſe own, that keeping a Miſs is ill, but they hold it a leſs evil to keep a good-humour'd handſom Miſs, than to live with an old ugly ill-natured Wife; for ſay they, one need keep a Miſs no longer than he likes and loves her; but one is ſtill bound to live with a croſs-grain'd Wife, though he is ſo far from loving or liking her, as he hates her; but this Argument carries no force, but in wickedneſs, being indeed as very ſenſeleſs and ridiculous, as its maintainers are highly impious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant; ſince a Man by living with his ugly Croſs Wife, may thereby often meet occaſions to exerciſe his patience, which may prove a vertue in ſome kind; but by keeping a Miſs, he can never by it exerciſe a vertue in any kind; beſides a Man by living with his Wife, tho' never ſo deform'd, does but what he ought; but a Man by keeping a Miſs, tho' never ſo handſom, does what he ought not, ſince in ſo doing he offends his God.</p>
               <p>There are another ſort of vicious young Sparks, who you will eaſily believe have not attained to years of diſcretion by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:38135:98"/>to Argue, that 'tis not a greater ill to keep a handſom Miſs, than for a Widow to Marry a bad Husband, but in my opinion this admits of no compariſon; for ſure no Widow can be ſo mad, as to Marry a Man, that ſhe is ſure beforehand will be a bad Husband. But all Men that keep Miſſes know beforehand, that by ſo doing they act a great ſin. A Widow by Marrying an ill Husband, only commits a fault againſt her own content, but he that keeps a Miſs, offends againſt his Makers command; which muſt needs be very much worſe, ſince an ill Husband can only diſturb the body, but a ſcandalous ſin may deſtroy the ſoul.</p>
               <p>But yet tho a Widows Marrying an ill Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, cannot poſſibly be of ſo ill a nature as a Mans keeping a Miſs, yet it may probably be of a much more laſting trouble, ſince an ill Husbands life is like to laſt much longer, than a fair Miſſes beauty; for we all know 'tis very cuſtomary, for Miſs keepers love, to end with their Miſſes beauty, ſince their beauty only makes the love.</p>
               <p>In a word, I have known ill men that have made kind Husbands, ſo that 'tis poſſible a Widow may Marry an ill Man, and not be miſerable; but 'tis impoſſible a Man can keep a Miſs, and not be wicked.</p>
               <p>'Tis a common Proverbial ſaying, <hi>That a Wife is a neceſſary Evil,</hi> which I fancy, is not to be taken in the ſenſe moſt do, that Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:38135:99"/>not live without them; but becauſe Men are ſtill bound to live with them; for whilſt they are Wives, tho far from being good ones, yet poor Husbands are oblig'd to ſerve out their time of bondage, according to agreement <hi>for better for worſe, till death them do part.</hi> But now for the new Mode of <hi>protempore</hi> Wives, called <hi>Miſſes,</hi> they are generally look'd upon by our Gallants, and keepers of them, as only Tenants at will, to Mens Perſons, and Purſes; being tied to them in no other manner, than we are to reading Romances, on which we may begin when we will, and leave off when we pleaſe, for we are not oblig'd to read longer in them, than they ſuit our humor, and pleaſe our fancy.</p>
               <p>Indeed Miſſes are now become in moſt great Towns, (eſpecially <hi>London</hi>) to Gentlemen, as Books are in <hi>Stationers Shops to Scholars,</hi> where they may pick and chuſe, Read ſometimes this kind of Books, another that ſort, all, or any, and hire them by the Day, Month or Year; and when they have read them over as oft as they pleaſe, and have no longer delight in them, or farther uſe of them, they may return them, and leave them where they found them, and there's no harm done, they lying ready expos'd for the next Courteous comer.</p>
               <p>Miſſes in Towns are like Free-booters at Sea, no Purchaſe, no Pay, they are never out of their way, (except to Heaven) ſo they can
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:38135:99"/>but meet a prize in it; indeed our fine young Gallants are wiſe in this particular, (but pray do not ask me in what other leſt you puzle me,) and this their wiſdom conſiſts only in chuſing of two evils the leaſt; for they will keep Miſſes which is ill, but they will not be bound to keep them longer than during pleaſure, which is leſs ill than a longer time; that is, they will be tied to Miſſes by no other Law, than that dearly beloved one of ſweet variety, Miſſes being to be us'd but like ſlight ſummer Garments, which are only uſeful in the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spring or hot Summer Seaſon of Mens Lives, and may without much Ceremony, or great difficulty be put on, or caſt off; ('twere well if the ſin of uſing them could be ſo too) lightly worn, and cheaply bought; Miſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a kind of Summer-Fruit, for preſent eating, not long keeping, for their beauty will never hold out long after a hot <hi>Venus</hi> blaſt, or burning clap of thunder, and their Bodies are often withered and rotten before they are near ripe, in ſubſtance and perfection, as many of the Merchant Adventurers in that Trade, can tell you by woful experience.</p>
               <p>And therefore young Men do wiſely in not binding themſelves to them, in Health, and Sickneſs, for then they are not only uſeleſs but chargeable; not till death them do part, but till their Miſſes beauties does decay, or their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on change; for Miſs-Love muſt ſtill be Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:38135:100"/>becauſe it ceaſeth to be Love, when it ceaſeth to be Paſſionate, having no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to cheriſh and maintain it; and therefore uſually ſuch Mens Love, expires aſſoon as their Miſſes beauty breaks, or may be ſooner, if he be taken with a more agreeable object, for his preſent fancy and conveniency; for though moſt of our young Gallants Love conſtantly, yet few are conſtant in their Amours; for tho they are ſtill Loving, 'tis Women more than a Woman; for conſidering they are only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to Inconſtancy, they can only keep the name of Conſtant Lovers, as Rivers ſtill keep the ſame Name, tho they are never two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes the ſame Water, they ſtill running into the Sea, as Springs are ſtill running into them.</p>
               <p>Indeed if young Gallants were bound to keep their Miſſes during life, ſuch an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would come ſo near to matrimonial bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, as our young Gallant, on thoſe terms, would as little love and like a handſom young Miſs, as an ugly old Wife, all confinements to our Sparks of the times being odious.</p>
               <p>O what a brave World and pleaſant Age do we live in, when new ſetts of Miſſes, are now grown modiſh marks of Greatneſs, as numbers of Wives and Concubines were ſigns of Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s days, which is the only thing I know our young Gallants imitate him in, and their only grand reaſon for doing it, is meerly becauſe Chriſts holy Goſpel forbids them doing it.</p>

               <p>Really the Drunkards in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s days, were a kind of ſober Men to the Libertins of our Age; for they knowing their deeds were evil and ſcandalous, had ſo great a ſenſe of modeſty and ſhame, (tho not of ſin,) as to caſt a vail of darkneſs over them, to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Debauchery from the ſight of others, which is implied by S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>Thoſe that are Drunken, are Drunken in the Night;</hi> but the Debauchees of our times, ſo glory in their own unſhamefulneſs as they expoſe their Perſons and Vices, (I might have ſaid Sins) to the open Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, and publick Aſſemblies; and are ſo far from caſting a vail, either to cover their own ſhame, or their Miſſes painted faces, as many of our young Sparks, nay, others that are more than middle aged Sinners, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Miſſes Coaches to themſelves, but with Coachmen in their own Livery, for fear all might not know whoſe Miſſes they are, and who keeps them, to ſhew to the World that their vile impudence ſcorns all ſober Mens cenſure, as well as it defies the great Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p>This baſe ſpecies of mercenary Miſs Love, being grown as very common as themſelves are, who are as impudent in their Carriage, as lewd in their Actions; and really 'tis now grown a diſputable queſtion which now abounds moſt in <hi>London,</hi> Hackny Coaches,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:38135:101"/>or Hackny-Women, Tradeſmen or Trading-women.</p>
               <p>Thus impudence is now become a kind of Staple Commodity in our Kingdom of Love, it being now adays eſteem'd a ſhameful meanneſs of Spirit in a young Gentleman, to be out of countenance for keeping a Miſs, but grown no ſhame at all to keep one; they being now looked upon but as marks of greatneſs and riches, and ſigns of Youth, health, faſhion, and gaity; but never in the leaſt thought on, to be the ſad effects of ſin, ſhame, folly, and wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>O ſtrange change! That ſin ſhould be thus ſupported by a cuſtomary impudence, and vertue ſuppreſſed by a general Cuſtom: Thus the tolerated, nay I might have ſaid incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging mode of acting this ſin, has taken away both the ſhame and conſcience of committing it; yet as very debauch'd as our Age is, we ought not to caſt our faults on it, for there can be no time ſo bad, as to render ſins neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; for general Cuſtom, can never juſtifie particular faults, ſince we might all live well, if we did not ſpend our time ill; for the will in her immediate operations, neither depends, nor moves by the temper of the body, or the faſhion of the times, but by the motions of the mind, in her own Reſolutions.</p>
               <p>In a word, keeping of Miſſes, is now grown ſo common, not only among great Men, but
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:38135:101"/>others of as bad Lives, tho' not of ſo great Eſtates; that now as to the keeping of Miſſes, there's nothing in it ſo ſtrange, as that any ſhould think it ſo.</p>

                  <hi>THE ELEVENTH DISCOURSE,</hi> Of the vain folly of ſuch Ladies who think to ſhew their Wit, by Jeering and Cenſuring their Neighbours.</head>
               <p>INdeed there would not need many Lines or Arguments on this Subject, to diſſwade Ladies from Jeering at others Faults, if they would but ſeriouſly reflect on their own; for then certainly they would neither accuſe others, nor juſtifie themſelves, but avoid keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Company with, or at leaſt practiſing of, this baſe ill natur'd and uncharitable vice, of Jeering and Cenſuring their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>We read in the Goſpel of S. <hi>John, how the Scribes and Phariſees brought before our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, the Woman that was taken in the Act of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, to tempt him,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Moſes in the Law commanded us, that ſuch ſhould be ſtoned, but what ſayeſt thou?</hi> and after often asking,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:38135:102"/>
                  <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them, he that is without ſin among you, let him caſt the firſt ſtone at her; and they that heard it being convicted in their own Conſciences, went away one by one, and all left her;</hi> for as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>who is ſo pure as to have no ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If all Cenſorious Ladies would but truly and heartily apply this ſaying to themſelves, and fancy our Saviour now ſaying unto them, the Lady that is free from fault among you, caſt the firſt Jeer at your Neighbour, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Ladies would be ſo Conſcious of their own Guilt, as they would preſently all leave this filthy ſin, as the Scribes and Phariſees did the Adulterous Woman.</p>
               <p>For there's no Woman in this World of ſo holy and pure a mixture, as to be free from any ſtain and fault, for then ſhe muſt be more than a Woman; and therefore all Ladies ought to make it their buſineſs rather to mend their own faults, than make it their paſtime to Jeer at thoſe of others, which very likely they are guilty of themſelves, and to conſider, ſince all are infected, none ought to cenſure any, but every one to repent in particular for himſelf, and to be ſorry in general for all.</p>
               <p>I have known ſome ordinary home-ſpun wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Women, who have proclaim'd themſelves very fooliſh in great Companies, and have ſhew'd their want of wit in attempting to Jeer at others above their reach, having only ſlight
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:38135:102"/>Ideas, of which they pretended to have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge, and ſo have expoſed their faint glimmering wit and flaſhy talk, of ſelf conceitedneſs, on a Candleſtick, to be judged, and look'd into by every prying and abuſive Critick, which had been much better kept at home under a Buſhel, among their Friends and Neighbours; many of theſe pretenders to Ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying wit, fancying they have a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things when they do not underſtand, nor ſo much as know, that they do not know it; for there's a knowledge of Ignorance, as well as an Ignorance of knowledge, and ſome ſin by a preſumption of knowledge, as well as others do by an ignorant preſumption; and therefore ſuch Women pretenders to wit, may be aſſured that they have great reaſon to wiſh for a deliverance from their unknown igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as well as holy <hi>David</hi> teacheth all Men to beg pardon of God for their ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known faults. 'Tis in ordering of wit, as in managing of a voyce, ſhe that has an indifferent ſweet low voyce, and ſings within its reach, may do it agreeable enough; but if ſhe ſtriving to ſing better than ſhe can, over mounts and ſtretches her voyce, by ſo overſtraining it; ſhe raiſes her weak voyce to meer ſqueaking, and ſo renders it more diſcord than good vocal Muſick.</p>
               <p>So truly an indifferent Wit that moves in the Sphere of her own ability, may paſs for good witty pleaſant Company; but if ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:38135:103"/>to talk of what ſhe does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and by endeavouring to make witty ſcoffs on others, to caſt only ſome groſs foul ſlanders on them; ſuch a one drowns her ſmall Spring of wit, in the Ocean of her folly, and receives but contempt, inſtead of praiſe.</p>
               <p>For my part I have a more nice opinion of that they generally call ignorance, than uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt have; for many eſteem ignorance to conſiſt only in the want of School learning, others in that of Hiſtory, Philoſophy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, Politicks, or the not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Affairs of the World, and the Intrigues of Courts, and the Men and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it, when in real truth, one may be a perfect Maſter of Art in all theſe, and yet be an ignorant Freſh-man in the very dawning, and beginning of true Wiſdom, the fear of God; which truth is confirmed by a wiſer <hi>Solomon,</hi> than any that dares contradict it; 'tis only that wiſdom that leadeth to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Therefore I am of opinion that a Learned Man that knoweth much, and lives ill, and is uncharitable; is much more ignorant, than that Lady who knows little, and prays much, and gives Alms plentifully; and this occaſioned the Wiſeman to eſteem Worldly wiſdom but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe it maketh not wiſe to ſalvation, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>that worldly knowledge puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth up, but charity edifieth,</hi> and both Gods Word, and our own experience, (if we are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,)
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:38135:103"/>can aſſure us, <hi>that a good Conſcience,</hi> (which our gracious God never denies to thoſe that beg it with great zeal, and in good time) <hi>is a continual feaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore your vain Ladies cannot but own in ſpight of all their averſneſs to it, that there muſt be much more wiſdom in going to the Houſe of Prayer, than paſtime to go to the Play-houſe; though if we look into the ſeats on Sundays, and at the boxes on all the Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, we ſhall find more Ladies ſet out at this, than that; tho we know one is the great duty of Religion, and the other but a meer delight of fancy.</p>
               <p>And if the fine Ladies and young Sparks, could read this and not be angry, I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to conſider ſeriouſly; tho I know ſerious conſideration is very unmodiſh, and conſequently very unuſual among them to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and ſo uncivil in me to ask, what are witty Plays, and fine Romances; truly Plays of the very beſt ſort are but fine pleaſant Plots, ſometimes taken out of true Story, ſometimes raiſed by meer fancy; well acted, and finely repreſented on the Stage, richly gilded and ſet out with fine Scenes, quick Wit, pleaſant Fancy, good Humor, modiſh Dreſs, and pure double refined Language, exactly fitted and tun'd to the preſent temper of the Times; and when all this is done, tho one may hear much wit in them, yet none can learn much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:38135:104"/>by them; Plays being writ for meer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime to pleaſe the fancy, more than inſtruct the underſtanding, made to get the Poet praiſe, and the Players mony, rather than to teach the hearers vertue.</p>
               <p>And ſo of Romances what are they other, than a pleaſant ingenious mixture of fiction, made up in a large Volume of extraordinary Adventures, and witty well compoſed fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; rarely ſet out, and richly adorn'd, with pure ſmooth Romantick Language, of ſtrange things done, and fierce love made, by Knights Errants in the Air, where the Lovers perform a thouſand Miracles in Fights, and ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, killing Men without ever hurting them, or ſo much as drawing their Sword towards it; (for all ſuch relations are writ to the height of Invention, no matter if it ſurpaſſes all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of performance, for thoſe niceties are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in Romances,) and ſay all the fine things imaginable, without ſpeaking aword, and follow their Miſtriſſes over many Kingdoms, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as ſtirring one ſtep after them; ſo that I may truly enough ſay, that a Romance, is a Monſter, compoſed of great contrarieties, and high falſities.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, when you have once read over a Romance, tho it be never ſo good and pleaſant, yet 'tis but a kind of dull entertainment, to read it a ſecond time, a Romance being like a Stratagem of War, never to be uſed well but
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:38135:104"/>once. And yet theſe Plays and Romances are ſo many in number, and ſo highly in eſteem, with our vain young Ladies, and fine Sparkiſh Gallants, as among many of them, they make it the main imployment of their Study, and the Library of their Books, (except perhaps an old <hi>Practice of Piety</hi> of the family, all moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy through long keeping, and never uſing) being the great Treaſury of their Wit, and the chief ſubject of their Diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>Indeed the vain flaſhy Wit of Plays and Romances, is but like ſweet Flowers, or a fine delightful Voice; they can only for a little time, recreate and refreſh the Senſes, but can never benefit the Soul, or ſatisfie the neceſſities of the Body; which can never be fully fed, either by the Ears or Eyes.</p>
               <p>And as the light of the Sun, tho it be of a moſt excellent general influence, yet alone could produce nothing; ſo a general Jeering wit, of it ſelf can never bring forth any thing to ſtrengthen the judgment, or improve the underſtanding; becauſe it will not make uſe of the good Guides of Vertue, Prudence, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and Piety, to direct it, on what Subject it may fall on, on what occaſion it ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in, and by what degrees and meaſures it ought to move, with fitting conſiderations of the perſons, time, and place; and ſuch Wits as will not obſerve theſe Rules, their drolling Wit will work like new Wine in old Bottles, which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:38135:105"/>will be ſure to burſt and flie about, to the prejudice of themſelves as well as others.</p>
               <p>And now if the vain Ladies will but give themſelves the trouble to obſerve carefully one of theſe common pretenders to rallying wit, (for all jeering wits are but pretenders; for if they had good wit, they would never be jee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers) you will find ſuch a one chiefly made up of thoſe four Elements in compoſition, <hi>viz. Extravagancy</hi> and <hi>Diſſimulation, Cowardiſe</hi> and <hi>Indiſcretion,</hi> all which he practiſes to every point of the Compaſs, guiding all his rambling talk by them, which is commonly ſo rude and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſive, as it cauſes all modeſt and vertuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſhun and deteſt the company, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; for the hearts and tongues of ſuch Men like ill Neighbours hardly ever meet in Unity and Communion one with another, they living in their bodies, as their eyes do in their heads, which tho ſtill very near, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee one another; in ſhort your Jeerers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly want juſtice and conſideration, either to ſpeak what they think, or to think of what they ſpeak, ſhooting their words at meer ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and ſo will be ſure to have their ſhare in the Proverb, <hi>That a fools bolt is ſoon ſhot,</hi> for their Tongue can only abuſe themſelves, not others: They hate a quiet ſetled Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never at reſt, but whilſt they are rambling from one Company to another, and never ſo well as when in motion; like ſome froward
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:38135:105"/>Infants, that are never at quiet longer than they are Rock'd in the Cradle, and aſſoon as that is at reſt, they are not. And now I have nam'd a Cradle, I cannot but fancy that many of theſe ignorant pretenders to wit, <hi>got a knock in their Cradle,</hi> which has hindered their Brains, and conſequently their Tongues, from being well ſetled ever ſince.</p>
               <p>And as one may rationally enough conclude of the common Habit and Dreſs of a Nation, by only ſeeing one juſt come out of it, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved long in it; ſo I fancy I may here venture to make a ſhort deſcription of the common nature of moſt of theſe drolling abuſive Wits, by here making a Juſt repreſentation, and giving you a true Picture of one of them, tho in little.</p>
               <p>A common publick pretender to Jeer and abuſe others, with his rallying Wit, is uſually one, who makes it his great delight, and chief buſineſs to inquire, and prie into, others Mens words and actions, and to make his venomous Reflections on them, he only paſſing through their Diſcourſes, as a Spie does an Enemies Country, with a miſchievous deſign, to obſerve and return Intelligence of the defects and weakneſs in it, and then to be ſure to attack thoſe weaker parts with his ſharp abuſes; for if a Man has never ſo many vertues, and has but one vice, he will be ſure to skip them all, to fall foul on that one; as flies leave the whole body, to faſten on the leaſt gawl'd patch:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:38135:106"/>for ſuch abuſive Wits are like Surgeons, who live by others hurts, and have nothing to do with thoſe parts that are ſound.</p>
               <p>A cenſorious ſcoffing Wit, is ordinarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and made up of ſuch a kind of Stuff as Fire-ſhips are, which ſerve for no other uſe, and are built and kept for no other purpoſe than to do miſchief; the only good in them conſiſts in doing harm, ſo the ſpirit and quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of theſe Mens ill temper'd venom, lies chiefly in abuſiveneſs, turning all their Notes to the ſame Tune that the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> did <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> words, only to raiſe and ſpend their mirth on, though to the prejudice of their deareſt Friends, and neareſt Relations, which they had rather loſe than their Jeſt.</p>
               <p>A common Talkative raillier ought by his Trade to be ſo couragiouſly ſtout, or rather fool hardy, as not to fear jeering every one; and yet indeed the Generality of them are ſo tame and Cowardly (for a generous mind ſcorns ſuch a baſe and mean imployment) as to endure (as he well deſerves) the ſlights and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of all he plays upon; for tho he makes War againſt the whole Kingdom with his Tongue, yet he dares not fight with one Man in it with his Sword, and indeed for this he may well pretend ſome reaſon, (which I am ſure he cannot for Jeering all Men,) firſt becauſe a Sword is much ſharper, and can wound far deeper than his Tongue; and next if he ſhould
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:38135:106"/>fight with every Man he raillies, and takes the liberty to abuſe, he muſt fight more Duels in the Field, than ever Captain <hi>Beſſus</hi> received Challenges in the Play; but my Gentleman is too wiſe in his Mirth to expoſe his body to ſuch a ſharp Encounter. In a word, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee this fierce <hi>Satyriſt</hi> drawn to the life, you need but look on S. <hi>George</hi>'s picture drawn a horſeback, where he is ſtill holding up his hand, but never ſtrikes; for he fears danger like a poor-ſpirited Mortal, though he lives, as if he thought he ſhould never die.</p>
               <p>This ſort of Men that make it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with their pretending Wit, to abuſe all Perſons; all the ill I need ſay of them, (for they ſay enough of themſelves) is, that they take upon them an employment which they muſt have a great ſhare of Wit to perform well, and muſt much want diſcretion to undertake at all; for at beſt if they are Maſters of any Wit, they employ it ill, ſince they do not live ſo much by their own wit, as by others folly.</p>
               <p>I hope now the vain Ladies that are given to Jeering will pleaſe to take notice, that I have on this Subject uſed them with the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that Tutors do young Princes, who when they have committed any great fault, inſtead of whipping them, whip their favourite play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow, for their Fault; that the Prince ſeeing the ſevere puniſhment uſed on their favorite
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:38135:107"/>boy, may by his Chaſtiſement avoid acting himſelf, the like fault for the future.</p>
               <p>So tho I do not here name the Ladies, that are given to this filthy ill-natured vice; yet I aſſure them this Diſcourſe was writ meerly for them, and aims only at them, as knowing it a Crime, that moſt of them through vanity do affect; and truly this baſe fault of Cenſuring muſt needs appear worſe in a young Lady, than in any other; for as a black ſpot ſhews the clearer, the whiter the skin is that 'tis placed upon; ſo ſharp raillery, and abuſive wit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the more black and foul, coming out of the mouth of a beautiful Lady, whoſe words ought to be full of ſweetneſs ſuitable to her looks.</p>
               <p>And let me tell you this great Truth, that our pert Cenſorious Ladies might in a far ſhorter time, and with much leſs pains, and abundant more content to themſelves gain the bleſſed Title of good Chriſtians, than the bad Character of being witty and profane Jeſters; which can only for a little time give them the applauſe of ſome irreligious and ill diſpoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe praiſes are really but diſcommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Whereas a truly pious and vertuous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, will ſtill juſtly deſerve, and ever conſtantly receive the true eſteem and commendation of godly ſober Men in this World; beſides ſecuring to herſelf Eternal happineſs in the next.</p>
               <p>Therefore if any of our vain Ladies deſire to attain this happy ſtate of bliſs, let me here
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:38135:107"/>aſſure them, that their right way to it, is wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and charitably to Judge themſelves, and not others, and inſtead of Jeering at others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to mend their own; by firſt repenting of their own immoralities, and then being ſorry for thoſe that do not the like for theirs; for as wiſe <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, <hi>He that does good to another, does good to himſelf, not only in the Conſequence, but in the very preſent act of doing it; for the Conſcience of well doing, is a very pleaſant ample reward in it ſelf;</hi> and therefore (I am ſure) tho it be a very unmodiſh advice, yet 'tis a very good Chriſtian doctrin, not to undo a Ladies reputation to pleaſe your own boundleſs and extravagant fancy in being admired and thought witty in doing miſchief, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis rather a Chriſtian duty if you ſee your Neighbour lie under any affliction, or live under any imputation of ſcandal, that you are free from, to correct your proud and high minded thoughts in fancying that by this you merit ſo much better than ſhe; but rather thank God, that he is more merciful to you than her, and be ſtill reforming other Womens faults, by your own good example, rather than continue to inflame them by your ſharp inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, and malicious Cenſures, which often create bitter Enemies, but ſeldom make good Friends or better Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.3. <hi>It is an honour to avoid ſtrife, but every fool will be medling;</hi> all
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:38135:108"/>Ladies ought ſo to govern their Diſcourſes, as to make them civil and obliging, not indiſcreet and Cenſorious; but to be ſuited to the time, place, and company you are in, for airy talk, and rallying mirth, would not agree but look ill at a ſad, and grave Funeral aſſembly; and ſo on the other hand, an abundance of gravity and reſervedneſs muſt be very unbecoming, as being very unſuitable to a Jovial Wedding-Company met only to feaſt, dance and be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for then gravity would paſs for a kind of diſlike as if you cenſured others jollity.</p>
               <p>We read in Scripture of Tongue Murderers, who tho they are bloudleſs, yet are not guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>That a whiſperer ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates chief Friends;</hi> and yet how common is it among our vain young witty Ladies, to make defamation their chief talk, and whiſpering of lies againſt their Neighbours the main Topicks of their Diſcourſe, if not the conſtant enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of their Viſiters, eſteeming it but a part of modiſh Repartee and fine breeding, to ralily at and cenſure others, and to make ſport at their infirmities; nay often create falts meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make ſport, ſo they be but wittily inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, no matter how unjuſtly they are raiſed; ſure ſuch Ladies never read that ſaying of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, That to do miſchief is the ſport of a fool, and he that uttereth a ſlander is one;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe muſt be much worſe than a fool, that not only vents, but invents ſlanders.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:38135:108"/>
               <p>How common is it among our vain witty Ladies, to make a quarrel, rather than loſe a Jeer, and diſoblige a good Neighbour, ſooner than ſtifle a witty Jeſt; and ſo as the Wiſe man ſays, make ſport with caſting out Fire-brands, never conſidering, (at leaſt not caring,) that an unjuſtice done to your Neighbour is a ſin againſt God; for tho you really only aim it at your Neighbour, yet being forbidden by God, your diſobedience renders it a ſin againſt God himſelf: And 'tis little leſs to Jeer at any ones natural defects or infirmities, as being born ugly, crooked or the like, ſince 'tis in a manner reproaching God for making them ſo.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould I ſpend time in taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Ladies jeering at others ill ſhapes, bad faces, or little wit, when many of the young Atheiſtical fry of our times, are ſo profane, as to pick out faults, in Gods ſacred Word, and ſo railly at, what they ought to adore, and can only hope to be ſaved by; I am ſure our bleſſed Saviours Doctrin is ſo far againſt the ſcandalous abuſes and cenſures of the Age, wherewith ſome reproach their Neighbours, who have been poſſibly injurious to them; that he forbids us to return them never ſo little, tho they are giving us never ſo much, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us not to rail and jeer at them, that jeer and rail at us; <hi>but to pray for our Enemies, and to do good to thoſe that ſpitefully uſe us;</hi> God having inſtituted it as a Fundamental
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:38135:109"/>Law to Mankind, not to do our Neighbours any harm, in Body, Goods, or good Name; but to do them all the good we can in every of them.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, this is the ſad and unequal deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moſt vain handſom Ladies, both as to themſelves, and others; which is to be angry with their Neighbours without a Cauſe, and never to be angry at themſelves, tho they have one, many of the vain Ladies eſteeming it a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground of quarrel, and anger, at other young Ladies for being more handſom than they; but forget at the ſame time to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at themſelves for being leſs pious than them, <hi>in not loving their Neighbours as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> for if they did, they would never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, what they would not take.</p>
               <p>But ſo vain and wicked is our Age, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cuſtom, and little Conſideration, makes many of the vain witty Ladies to fancy, that Romantick Lies, and detracting Jeers, are but Wind, which if granted, yet it cannot be denied, but the often repetition may unite them into a ſtorm of ſins; for does not experience teach us, that light flakes of Snow, that ſingly ſcarce weigh any thing, being but a kind of half con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed Atoms, yet do often by their long uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Confluence ſwell into an ability of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Houſes and Families in ſpite of their greateſt reſiſtance.</p>

O vain Ladies, if you will not for your own and ſhame ſake, at leaſt for vertue and honour ſake, abandon raiſing all wicked ſcandals on your Neighbours, and baniſh from your practice, all impertinent ſenſeleſs ſtrifes, all cenſuring twatles, and ſharp offenſive ſcoffs, which tho a mode vice, is ſo great a Crime, as it truly requires a ſtrict Repentance, and a high Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the offence to the Perſons ſo injured; and that ſuch ſcandalous Jeerers would for the future, as <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>Keep a Bridle in their Mouth, that they offend not with their Tongue;</hi> and ſo new mould, and well regulate it, as inſtead of uſing it as an Engine to rack their Neighbours Reputation with, they may
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:38135:110"/>henceforward, employ and conſecrate it to the ſetting out, and ſtretching forth, their vertue and good name; and let all your ſtrife be in a pious Emulation of vertue and holineſs, and in religious endeavors who ſhall excel, and take place in the true and conſtant practice of them, in their lives and converſation; for in them conſiſts not only the greateſt wiſdom, higheſt wit, but alſo the beſt breeding, and moſt ſublime and ſplended beauty, being the everlaſting one of holineſs, beſides that of pure honour indeed; for Goſpel Heraldry muſt ever be the very beſt, for the greateſt Monarch in this World muſt live a ſinner, but the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Woman in it, by her living a godly and vertuous life, may die a Saint, and therefore it muſt certainly be much better to live well, and ſo die happily, than to be born great, left rich, or look handſom; for the beauty of a fair delicate Complexion, may be a Womans own purchaſe, not Natures gift, and her high Title, and great Eſtate, may be left her by her friends, without being in the leaſt merited by her ſelf; but to be highly pious, and truly vertuous, muſt moſt certainly be the true and lawful Iſſue of a Womans own Religious inclinations: Therefore I ſhall conclude this Diſcourſe, with this undeniable Truth, That true goodneſs, is true greatneſs; and that Lady will be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in the other World, that lives the beſt in this.</p>

                  <hi>THE TWELFTH DISCOURSE,</hi> Of <hi>French</hi> Faſhions and Dreſſes, now uſed in <hi>England,</hi> by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Ladies, and young Sparks.</head>
               <p>DIvines tell us, that perfect life may be ſeen in ſhort meaſures, &amp; Painters aſſure us that exact beauty may be drawn in ſmall proportions, and experience ſhews us, that an infinity of words, is made of a few letters; and 'tis approv'd by the great Wits, and Poets of the Stage, that a ſhort Prologue may ſuit well with a long Play; and ſince I do not here pretend, nor indeed ſo much as ambition to keep company with their great Wit, I hope they will admit me to follow their ſhort mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and by their example juſtifie this my ſmall diſcourſe from appearing very unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this large Theme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Character of a Covetous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſays, <hi>He is one whom God hath given riches and honour to, ſo that he wanteth nothing of all that he deſires, but God giveth him not the power
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:38135:111"/>to eat thereof;</hi> which is an evil Diſeaſe, becauſe ſuch a Man wanteth even what he hath; what can ſuch a miſerable be call'd better than a ſad wretch, that makes himſelf a voluntary Slave, to labour in the Mines of his own wealth, and Vaſſal-like only to enjoy the drudgery part for his own ſhare, making his wealth a burden, without reaping any true pleaſure or advantage by it; ſo that ſuch a Man, tho' he be never ſo rich, muſt die in debt to himſelf; for he ſtrips himſelf of neceſſaries during his own life, to make his Children a Wardrobe after his death.</p>
               <p>I am ſure the prodigality of our <hi>London</hi> Gallants is after a quite different Manner; for ſo they can but make a Wardrobe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and Miſſes during their own lives many of them care not tho' they leave their Children in a condition to want neceſſaries after their death, which too many of them can juſtifie by woful experience; ſeveral of their Fathers Eſtates, that did belong to them as their Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, by their Parents luxury, pride, and folly, have been made a ſacrifice to the extravagant expences, and vain profuſeneſs of their Miſtriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes pride, and their own ſottiſhnefs, as that they have left nothing to their Heirs of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, but the wind, (as <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſes it,) <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.29. <hi>The certain loſs of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Eſtate, and the uncertain getting another for themſelves if they can.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:38135:111"/>
               <p>I have read of a Philoſopher that was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by his friends to leave his retirement for a little time to ſee a fine Shop plentifully ſtor'd with all manner of rich things, and fine knacks, and being asked what he thought of all thoſe rare things: I am thinking (ſaid he) what a World of things are here I do not want, for what's more than we uſe, is more than we need.</p>
               <p>I am confident if one of our fine <hi>London</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies had been ſhewn that ſight, and asked that queſtion; her anſwer had been, what a World of things I want that are not here, which much juſtifies a Writers ſaying, that the ancient <hi>Latins</hi> called Womens Wardrobe, <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> a World; yet I find in the Map of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens ornamental Dreſſes, reckoned by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the ſum total of them there named, to be but twenty one; which clearly ſhews the vaſt difference between the twenty one years of Men, and the twenty one Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Women; for by the Law of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, all Mens years under one and twenty, are not allow'd to reach diſcretion; but our Prophet ſeems here to ſay, that by the Law of God, all Womens Dreſſes, that amount to, much more that paſs beyond twenty one, muſt exceed all diſcretion; for certainly they muſt be too many for Women to wear, whom God declares too many for him to like.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:38135:112"/>
               <p>And tho without any diſpute 'tis a ſin to doubt, that thoſe ornamental Dreſſes which the Creator thinks too many, no Woman Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but ought to eſteem more than enough; yet ſo extravagant and phantaſtical are many of our fine Ladies and Gallants, as they are ſo far from eſteeming that Number ſufficient, as they ſend almoſt every week to <hi>Paris,</hi> for ſuch ſupplies of new faſhion Dreſſes, as one might as ſoon Climb up to the Top of all Numbers, as to hope to reckon the numberleſs variety of Womens Dreſſes; there belonging much more Rigging to ſet out a young Lady, than a Man of War; ſo hard 'tis to caſt up the variety of parts, as now adays belong to compleat a great Modiſh Ladies Dreſs and Equipage.</p>
               <p>And therefore I fancy an old Philoſopher gave both a good Reaſon and true Character of the faſhion of rich Dreſſes, <hi>That 'twas the deadly catching Diſeaſe of Women, and the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh paſſion of men.</hi> Indeed I find no reaſon to believe any of theſe kind of Ladies are know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Philoſophy, becauſe they cannot be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Wiſdom, that are haters of Diſcretion which makes a main part of it. But I have a great deal of reaſon to believe that they are knowing in Satans Arithmatick, and too well underſtand ſinful Subtraction, and vain Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication, ſince we find ſo many of them can Subtract the Ten Commandments to the ſcarce keeping of one, and multiply the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:38135:112"/>one ornamental Dreſſes, to the uſing of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds.</p>
               <p>And the worſt of it, is, that not one of theſe twenty one Dreſſes are a kin to thoſe <hi>S. Peter</hi> adviſed the Women of his time to wear, <hi>which was not putting on Gold, or curling Hair, or what is Corruptible, but the Ornaments of a meek and quièt Spirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.3, 4. which exactly ſuits the true beauty of Religion, which the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>is of great price in the ſight of God,</hi> for that will render Women of ſo pious a Temper, as tho the youthful gaiety of their human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may make them think of the vain dreſſes of the times, yet their ſanctified minds will never let them forget to be true followers of the ſtate of Eternity.</p>
               <p>Indeed 'tis a hard meaſuring Caſt, whether their variety of vain extravagant Dreſſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves more Mens ſober pity, or contempt, moſt, I am ſure are fitter for either, than my deſcription; yet I muſt be Charitable to them, tho they are far from being ſo to themſelves, as to wiſh that theſe our fine young modiſh La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and their Gallants, would keep more Commandments, and uſe fewer Dreſſes, that they might thereby leſſen their own particular vanities, and moderate the general <hi>Engliſh</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry againſt <hi>French</hi> faſhions, which many think have not only over-run, but near deſtroyed, all our noble ancient great way of Living; and grave kinds of ſober Dreſſes.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:38135:113"/>
               <p>Sure if our fine young Ladies and great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts, would but a little ſeriouſly reflect of what moſt of their fine Clothes are made, they would not be ſo proud to glory in, what they really ought to be aſham'd off; for the fine Silks we wear, are but the workings of poor little Worms, and our fineſt Cloth is made of the Wooll of Sheep; ſo that our covering was but that of Beaſts, till our pride and vanity robb'd them of it.</p>
               <p>And indeed our great adored Miſtris Mony, which all, of all ſorts receive with ſo great joy, and entertain with ſo high delight, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true happy, and undecaying Miſtris in this World, for all Love her paſſionatly at once, and what's yet ſtranger than all, both Sexes are ſtill conſtant in their eager love, and great fondneſs of her; nay <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſo great an eſteem and value for Money, as he ſaid it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all things, yet if we truly look into its Extraction, we ſhall find it as very mean as that of our Clothes, for as <hi>Seneca</hi> well obſerves, <hi>That Gold and Silver were ſtill mixt, and never kept better Company than Earth and Duſt, till avarice and ambition raiſed and parted them, and ſo they became our Maſters as well as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O how ſtrangely is Apparel Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed! We read in <hi>Geneſis</hi> that it was firſt uſed to hide our Shame, but now 'tis worn to ſhew our Pride, and God knows if we truly conſider, we
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:38135:113"/>are very far from having any reaſon to boaſt of our Apparel, ſince 'tis but the cover of Shame and Sin, and therefore we ought to wear it but as deep mourning for the great loſs of our dear friend Innocency.</p>
               <p>Nor can any deny, but that Mourning is a Garment fitter according to the ſtricteſt nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our very preſent Modes, to denote true ſadneſs, than ſet out vain glory; to manifeſt grief, than expreſs joy; yet ſo evil is our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age, as many of the wicked brood of el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brothers, who as one ſaid, pray for their Fathers lives, but not their living, plainly ſhew at their Fathers death, in what a manner they are concern'd for his loſs, (not theirs) by their chearful Countenance, and Gay Lives; which clearly Proclaim that they Mourned ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe their Fathers lived ſo long, than died ſo ſoon, and ſo make their long funeral Cloaks, (which uſually weigh heavier on their Backs, than the cauſe of them on their Hearts,) rather a Habit of great Joy, than true Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But real Mourning hath nothing to do with our <hi>French</hi> Dreſſes, therefore this diſcourſe ſhall have no more to do with it; and I will now return to my Subject, and mind you that the <hi>French</hi> have brought into <hi>England</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrange Faſhions, as 'tis to be feared our young fry of Nobility, and Gentry, will eſteem piety and vertue as things quite out of faſhion,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:38135:114"/>and uſe; and indeed their Lives cannot be more extravagant and vain, than their Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, if I can properly ſay they have any left.</p>
               <p>Certainly if Sir <hi>John Suckling</hi> had lived to theſe times, he might well have added to that pithy ſaying of his, <hi>This trifle Woman, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man us all, and uncloath us too,</hi> for Doublets are quite left off by all the Modiſts: And for the Breeches moſt of our young Sparks, and ſome of the old Fops have loſt them alſo, being generally given by our Gallants to their Miſtriſſes, and by the meer Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to their Wives, which by the by, is a new Mode that contradicts the old Law, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Habits of ſeveral Sexes; ſo that if our Women increaſe thus in Power, and our Men continue ſo in folly, 'tis very probable, that thoſe of the next Age may ſee our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Modiſts pictur'd as they do Truth, that's naked.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſort of Men, if I may properly call them Men that have loſt their Manhood, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left off their Doublets, and yielded up their Breeches, have nothing on to wear but their Coats, which may indeed ſerve to cover their Nakedneſs, but can never hide their Shame; for ſo degenerating is their temper as to make themſelves ſervants to Women, whom by their birth-right they ought to rule over as Lords and Maſters; and what is worſe and ſtranger than all this, to be pleaſed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their ſervitude.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:38135:114"/>
               <p>I read of a great Politician that Counſelled his Prince, to reflect on the dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that might happen by admitting his Subjects to receive Penſions from forrein Kings; and his reaſon was, that forrein food, was apt to breed forrein blood in them. And indeed 'tis a ſaying as very true, as old, that uſe is a ſecond nature; we being apt to like beſt, what we are accuſtom'd to moſt; both hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory and our own experience afford us many ſtrange examples of the nature of Cuſtom, and among thoſe many, one of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was in my time in the Gallies at <hi>Marſeillies;</hi> where by long Cuſtom of being ſo, he not only grew a Contended Slave, but if I may ſo ſay, a Voluntier; for he was a good Gentleman of the Family of the <hi>Courtnies,</hi> and (as he ſaid) had ſome proſpect of an Eſtate in <hi>England;</hi> yet he choſe to continue that kind of Life, rather than enjoy his Liberty, which they ſay was offered to be procured for him; which mad refuſal of his, has totally defeated half the <hi>French</hi> Proverb, <hi>That there can be no ſuch thing in Nature, as an ugly Miſtris, or a handſom Priſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis an old Curſe among the <hi>Turks, I wiſh you as little reſt as a Chriſtians Hat,</hi> and I wiſh it may not grow a new Curſe among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>I wiſh you as little reſt as an</hi> Engliſh <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,</hi> for they are now ſo much <hi>Frenchefied,</hi> as they change oftner than the Moon, and reſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:38135:115"/>as little as the Sea, which is in a continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And I think I may properly enough ſay of Faſhions, what a Writer ſaid of Serving-Men, <hi>ſuch as are extraordinary Tall are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for Porters to Lords; and ſuch as are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Low, are taken to be Dwarfs to Ladies, whilſt Men of a good middle-ſize Stature, often want Maſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So all extremities of Faſhions are worn by many of the Lords and Ladies, but a ſober moderate Dreſs few will entertain.</p>
               <p>So much have theſe extremities of <hi>French</hi> Faſhions infatuated our minds, and debauch'd our fancies, that thoſe that do not exactly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Meaſures (tho they are above all needful uſe, and very much beſide all decent ſobriety) are eſteem'd as great Phanaticks, and Diſſenters to the gentile Rules of modiſh Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as any Nonconformiſt can be to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Church Diſcipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have fool'd our ſelves into ſuch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous extreams, as to make the <hi>French</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, to become not only the Standard of our Faſhions, but the very neceſſity of our Apparel; <hi>Paris</hi> being for Faſhions, like the <hi>Camelion</hi> for its Colours, who gives them to all beholders, whereas in all others we receive them from the Ideas of things we meet with.</p>
               <p>And indeed the <hi>French</hi> Faſhions change ſo often, and coſt ſo dear, that many of our young Fops that are newly got into their Eſtates, but
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:38135:115"/>not at all into their years of diſcretion, do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their vain faſhions and ſo (to be eſteemed modiſhly well bred,) in a little time, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſell their real Eſtates for ever; and if 'twere not for fear of grating your Ears with the unſavory ſound of a Clinch, I was juſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſay, that they are the very worſt ſort of Fools, that will ſell <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lordſhips to buy <hi>French</hi> Manners.</p>
               <p>As our Conditions are not alike, ſo our Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ought not to be the ſame, for our Clothes muſt match our Revenue, as well as fit our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for great Expences become a poor Man, as a large <hi>Switzers</hi> Breeches does a Dwarf. The Coſt of keeping a great Table, a rich Equipage, and a large Retinue, being only for a Perſon of great Quality, and good Eſtate; and he that ſells his Lands, only to live at ſuch a ranting extravagant rate, in a few Months ſhews his great folly, as well as merits the miſery of ſad want.</p>
               <p>Apparel like a River, is only good and uſeful, whilſt kept within the Banks and Limits of Moderation, but when it begins to ſwell and break out into exceſs, it is ſo far from being uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as it ſtill proves pernicious if not deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</p>
               <p>We read that the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſo very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and wiſe, as to baniſh out of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, ſuch as ſhould attempt to give any new advice in it, and I fancy the reaſon for it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:38135:116"/>was, that they believed there were more bad, than good Men in their Republic; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch more forward to receive ill Advice, than hearken to good Counſel. And ſince I put no Name here, I will venture to ſay, <hi>'Twere well the ſame Rule were uſed as to Dreſſes, and that any one that brought into</hi> England <hi>a new faſhion'd Dreſs according to the</hi> Paris <hi>Mode, might be baniſhed it;</hi> becauſe 'tis moſt certain there are more of our young Men and Women, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly given, than vertuouſly inclin'd; and conſequently more apt to imitate a new Mode, eſpecially if a <hi>French</hi> Dreſs, than any ſober decent Apparel of their own Country Growth; for indeed it may be truly ſaid of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> following <hi>French</hi> faſhions, what a Writer ſaid of <hi>Ariſtotle, that whatſoever indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted notions he vomited up, there were many young Philoſophers ready to lick them up;</hi> I am ſure what extravagant faſhions the <hi>French</hi> wear, too many people are apt to approve and follow.</p>
               <p>Really I cannot now but laugh, as well as wonder, when I think how our young <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility and Gentry, are tied and confined to the ſtrict Rules of the <hi>French</hi> faſhions; for our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Judgments (in that grand affair of Dreſſes) are only admitted to imitate and approve, and many imitate what they do not approve; for their Fancies are not allow'd to invent or chooſe, ſcarce add or diminiſh, but we muſt forſooth with an implicit Faith, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:38135:116"/>what the <hi>French</hi> wear, and to be as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible a rule to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Modes, as a Church Decree is a Guide to thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>In a word, our young Gallants are grown ſo very vain in their Apparel and Dreſſes, that deſiring to ſee change and exceſs of vanity, we need but look on one anothers vain change of Dreſſes, being almoſt as diverſe as the Perſons that wear them; and therefore 'tis impoſſible to view them all, but I can give you in a line this exact and true Character of them, <hi>That our Modes are become the effects of our vain fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick Prodigality, and more irregular Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed all our vain expenſive <hi>French</hi> Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, may make the Ladies or Gallants finer, but never better or worſer; for Embroidered Clothes to our Bodies, are but like flowers of Rhetoric in Speeches; they make the words ſound the ſweeter, but render not the ſenſe the better, it may pleaſe the Ear, but it does not improve the Judgment: Or like ſilver Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes on a Table, they may ſhew their own Coſtlineſs, but they make no addition or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Meat they contain, whatever they may do to the fancy of the Eater, or Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>Really if we would but allow Conſcience or Reaſon a Vote in this affair, we ſhould ſoon be aſſured by them; that there appears more true wiſdom, and ſatisfaction in giving one
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:38135:117"/>Penny, as an Alms-deed for Chriſt's ſake, than in laying out many Pounds on bravery for our own; more real fine in Clothing one that's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, on a pious account of true Charity, than by bedawbing twenty footmen in Gold or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rich Liveries on the ſcore either of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Faſhion, and that becauſe it ſuits the <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Paris</hi> Mode. For I eſteem Livery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (excepting thoſe that are really neceſſary to a Mans perſon and Quality) but juſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Porters that are hired to carry about a Mans pride and folly, and the ſeveral Colours of his Liveries to be but ſo many Lures, and Jack Puddings to draw mens Eyes to behold a fair ſhew, not only of his own Pride, but often of his Merchants loſs; for 'tis now grown no common wonder, eſpecially in <hi>London,</hi> to ſee young Sparks Clothes, and their Footmens Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries to laſt longer in their Merchants books, than on their own, or Footmens backs, and they turned off, before the Books are Croſſed out.</p>
               <p>In a word, I wiſh our <hi>French</hi> faſhions, may not prove fatal follies, by being ſoon natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized into <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cuſtoms; for then let them be never ſo coſtly, ridiculous, and vain, like blackneſs among the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs may remove their deformity, but can never ſmother the prejudices againſt them.</p>
               <p>I will now only add this Conſideration to conclude all, in reference to our fine young
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:38135:117"/>
                  <hi>Frenchefied</hi> Ladies, and that is, that they would ſeriouſly reflect on the end of all their fine Modiſh Dreſſes, and their greater loſs of preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time they waſt about them, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions their minding ſo much the fineneſs of their Bodies, as many of them neglect by it the care of their Souls, the beſt and only laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part; and therefore they ſhould remember that they muſt die certainly, tho' they now live pleaſantly, and then all their plenty of finch rich <hi>Frenchefied</hi> Dreſſes will be contained in one poor Winding-ſheet, and their exact ſlender ſhape in a Coffin, and all their fine Gallants, and conſtant admirers, will leave them at the Grave, where their Bodies will be only fit to be enjoyed by naſty worms.</p>
               <p>This (young Ladies) is the true Epilogue to the ſad Tragedy of your vain Dreſſes, and what's yet worſe than all, your Souls will be in as ſad a condition as your Bodies after death without a hearty Repentance, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be without a real amendment, in aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning, not only great Sins, but vain exceſſes, as well in Dreſſes, as waſting time about them, and that you come to eſteem them as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> did the pleaſures of this World, only as vanity of vanities.</p>
               <p>Therefore all you young Ladies, that deſire to cloath your Souls in a Heavenly dreſs, adorn your Lives with conſtant Piety, and your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with modeſt and decent Clothing, ſuch as
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:38135:118"/>waſts not too much of your time or Eſtate; but wear ſtill what is moſt generally worn, and then you may be ſure, that few perſons will either gaze or laugh at you.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>THE THIRTEENTH DISCOURSE,</hi> Of Worldly Praiſes, which all Ladies love to receive, but few ſtrive to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; with the ſad end of it and them, when they come to Die.</head>
               <p>WOrldly Praiſe is a Subject I ſhall write little of, for theſe two Reaſons, firſt that I need not write for it, and next that I dare not write againſt it, for as one the one hand it would be vain and ſuperfluous to make that my buſineſs to commend, what all Praiſe; ſo on the other ſide, it would argue a great folly to write againſt that all the World writes for; therefore to prevent all I can writing ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly or fooliſhly, I ſhall only glance this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe on the Worlds high eſteem, and eager ambition after vain Praiſes; the deſires of gaining it being as inſeparable from moſt Men and Womens Actions, as Light is from the Sun, or heat from fire, and ſhall only name
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:38135:118"/>the common ways to it, and the uſual end of it, and them, when they come to die.</p>
               <p>Praiſe is that great Idol, which all people in the World adore and flatter as the Supream object of their pleaſure and delight, as having a perfect influence over all our Actions of what kind, degree, and quality whatſoever. And therefore let publick Writers ſay what they will, and pretend what they pleaſe, ſelf Praiſe is the Jack they all Bowl at, tho many take ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Grounds to it. And tho ſome Writers are more humble, and reſerv'd; more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and leſs opinionaters of their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, leſs apt to Cenſure thoſe of others, that differ in Opinion from theirs, than uſually moſt kind of Writers are; yet all of them court Praiſe, tho in ſeveral ſhapes and differing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>Some court Praiſe by their ingenious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, others think to gain it by their witty ſpeaking, and a third ſort hope to procure it by a diſcreet ſilence, relying upon wiſe <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>a Man of underſtanding holdeth his peace, and a Fool uſeth many Words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fineſt Ware is uſually the cloſeſt wrapt up, and Silence is not only ſtill uſeful to <hi>ſhelter</hi> a Fool, but often to diſcover a wiſe Man. 'Tis wiſdom to ſpeak when one ought, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when we ought not; he needs much Reaſon that ſpeaks well, but a little ſerveth him that holdeth his Peace; ſince he that takes upon
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:38135:119"/>him to ſpeak wiſely on a Subject, but does it ſimply, all hearers are Judges and witneſſes of his folly, but he that is ſilent, none can juſtly tell whether he can ſpeak wiſely or not, and ſo as to him, ought to hold their Peace, becauſe he does his.</p>
               <p>There are as many Roads and Paths to Praiſe as there are employments, I think I might well venture to ſay all Actions in the World, and hope of Praiſe is the common Guide and Conductor general to them all, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the greateſt Enemies, and moſt diſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the World, to agree in the bands of unity and friendſhip.</p>
               <p>Praiſe is the greateſt of all Levellers, for it brings the higheſt and loweſt degrees of Men to an equality; for the greateſt Monarch in the World, and the meaneſt Subject in his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are alike as to their deſires of Praiſe, tho they vaſtly differ in the manner and degrees of aſpiring to it; Praiſe is as a Sum writ in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, 'tis every Nations Language, and is, and will be every Countries ambition.</p>
               <p>And 'tis well worth obſervation, that this thing called Praiſe, is ſo light, airy, and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, as tho few are ſuch Fools to hope for a Livelihood ſolely from it, yet many are ſo mad as to expoſe their Lives meerly for it.</p>
               <p>Really the fine young Ladies need but open their Eyes, and they cannot but behold their partiality, in diſtributing of their Praiſes to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:38135:119"/>others, and in receiving others praiſes to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for if one of the Ladies is Miſtris of any one quality that they know is truly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they believe all the World looks on it, but then overſees all their vices that are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently faulty; ſo very wicked many young Women are, as to be more apt and ready, to ſee and blame their own faults in others, than to conſider or mend them in themſelves.</p>
               <p>And the like meaſures they uſually obſerve, as to the beauties, or defects of their bodies, if they have any part that is very handſom, they fancy all that look on them fix their eyes on it; but if their Noſe or Eyes be ugly, they think none takes notice of them; but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Lady that pretends to praiſes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this rate, to oblige me, or rather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo much as ſeriouſly to conſider this very plain queſtion. If you ſhould ſee a fine young Gentleman, of a fam'd vertuous Life, and moſt excellently well bred, and highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd for his true humility, and great Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; in a word, that was a Perſon indued with all the excellencies both of body and mind, that can render a Man compleatly perfect and admirable, only that he wanted an Eye; pray ask your ſelf, if you ſhould not be more ready to obſerve and blame the blemiſh of that one Eye, than to praiſe any of all his Excellencies; I am confident you cannot deny but you ſhould, and ſure ſuch a blind kind of imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:38135:120"/>in you, is as bad as the want of an Eye in him; for perhaps he loſt his Eye by a fit of ſickneſs, as many do in the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> which is now his great trouble, but never was at all his own fault, and therefore we ought rather to pity that misfortune, than jeer at that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: Or ſuppoſe he met that loſs in his Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and was in a manner born ſo; might you not then as wiſely, and reaſonably, deſpiſe the two grand Seaſons of the Year, the Summer for being too hot, and the Winter too cold, when they are not too immoderate, but you too fooliſh, for eſteeming them ſo.</p>
               <p>There is no Womans beauty under the Sun, that is ſo intirely perfect as to be without ſome Fault, for then ſhe muſt be more than Woman; nay the very glorious Sun it ſelf is not without its Eclipſes; yet ſure none can be ſo very fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh as not to admire and praiſe its ſplendour and brightneſs, though 'tis ſometimes obſcured with a Cloud.</p>
               <p>Nor can you propoſe to your ſelf, that 'tis a think fitting or reaſonable to deſpiſe and railly any man, becauſe he cannot work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and perform impoſſibilities, by raiſing the dead to life; for 'twould be as ridiculous in any one to hope to reſtore a loſt Eye, by wiſhing for it, as you to change the Seaſons of the Year, by your blaming of them.</p>
               <p>Therefore let me adviſe you inſtead of rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying at what cannot be help'd in others,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:38135:120"/>ſtrive to mend thoſe Faults which may be yet cured in your ſelf, which can never be well done, till you ſtill behold the defects of others with a ſad troubled Eye, which you cannot forbear doing, if you obſerve as you ought Gods Command <hi>of loving your Neighbour as your ſelf,</hi> for his afflictions muſt be then yours, as well as yours are now your own: And his blemiſhes or faults would be but ſo many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandums of your own frail defects, and ſo muſt render you more fit, and better diſpoſed to, ſupport thoſe of others, and rather make it your buſineſs to be concern'd for them, than your paſtime to jeer at them.</p>
               <p>In a word, the young Lady that enjoys that ſhare of beauty, which perhaps her Neighbour is troubled for the want of, let it not render her proud, that ſhe is more celebrated than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but rather let her expreſs her humility, and make it the great motive of her praiſe to God, that he has been ſo liberal to her in this perfection.</p>
               <p>But to return to my deſign'd Subject, Praiſes that are not ſtampt with true vertue and great merit, are but meer Air; all falſe Tongues can flatteringly give them, but 'tis only your own vertues that can juſtly merit them.</p>
               <p>'Tis with Praiſes, as with Faults, they that charge you with thoſe you are free from, do you no real hurt, and thoſe that preſent you with praiſes you no way deſerve, do you no
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:38135:121"/>real good; therefore to apply to your ſelf the right uſe of both, inſtead of being angry at others for accuſing you of ſome vices you do not act; be angry with your ſelf for acting the many you do, which is the true way of having Praiſes, and deſerving them too.</p>
               <p>Praiſe is not only the dearly beloved Miſtris of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Turky;</hi> for 'twas Praiſe that was the octaſion of making the grand <hi>Vizier Muſtapha</hi> loſe ſo many Men before <hi>Vienna;</hi> for his Story tells us, that he did not attempt that Siege ſo much to ſerve his Maſter, as to Court his Miſtris, more out of deſign to gain her, than out of hopes to take it; but <hi>Muſtapha</hi> was as much miſtaken in his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Conquering his Miſtriſſes heart, as in thoſe of taking <hi>Vienna;</hi> for by deſtroying her Husbands life, he totally deſtroyed her Love, and ſo made his Miſtris to revenge her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands death, to beg the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> to take away <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Life, which he did, and by it, ſhe ſhew'd her kindneſs to her Husband, and the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> his Juſtice to her.</p>
               <p>'Tis deſire of praiſe and ambition that makes the <hi>French</hi> King imploy ſuch vaſt Sums of Mony, and Armies of Soldiers to work about his Palace of <hi>Verſaillies,</hi> which is rather a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy of Riches, than a Miracle of Nature; fitter to be wondred at, for the vaſt expences laid out on it, than to be praiſed for any agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs about it, except the Gardens and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:38135:121"/>Water-works, which indeed excel all either of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Florence,</hi> and conſequently the whole World; but for the Houſe it ſelf, I could obſerve nothing in it extraordinary except the rich Gildings both within, and without; and therefore as to my own opinion of the Place, I think there's nothing ſo wonderful in all that glory, as that any one ſhould ſo much admire it, having neither River, Wood, good Land, or pleaſant Proſpect about it, being all round about cloſe beſieg'd by great coarſe and ragged Hills, which cannot add much luſtre and glory to the Situation of any place of ſuch vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and Magnificence, ſo as to be Celebrated by ſome as one of the Wonders of the World.</p>
               <p>We read in Hiſtory that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great expreſſed much trouble, that he had no more Kingdoms left him to Conquer; I am ſure the <hi>French</hi> King needs no cauſe of trouble, for want of more Hills to Conquer and ſite about his Palace of <hi>Verſaillies,</hi> as long as he lives, tho he had more Men and Mony to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy about levelling them, than now he has. Indeed ſuch a Royal Building of Magnificence well deſerved a moſt pleaſant and Stately Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, but it ſeems that King thought it more noble &amp; better becoming his greatneſs to make one by the expence of Art, than to be beholden to one of Natures free bounty, that the World might know, he ſcorn'd ſo mean an offer, whilſt he has Armies that can level Mountains
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:38135:122"/>as plain as he pleaſes, and Mony to mount Rivers as high as he deſires.</p>
               <p>And indeed if we range over not only <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Turky,</hi> but all the whole World, we ſhall find that Praiſe is the Butt all Shoot at, tho few hit the Mark; for if we but look narrowly into Praiſes, and conſider the Actions, as well as the Perſons, they are commonly great Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, and the breath of ſuch Praiſes, is but like a Rain-bow, which is no other than a meer ſeeming Collection of many bright Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, without any true ſubſtance, or long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, one day diſcovering the folly of the other, and a few days will ſhew you your own end, and with it the vanity of them all.</p>
               <p>Therefore if the young Ladies could but perſwade themſelves to think ſeriouſly of the little reality there is in the Praiſes Men preſent them, and the vain paſtimes the World deludes them with; both Women and Men will find that moſt of their delights are vain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable, for the poſſeſſion of much beauty breeds great pride, and high concern; and the decay of it creates in ſuch as much diſcontent and envy at what they then loſe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſee others enjoy. And ſo 'tis the ſame with many of Mens Worldly delights, which ſoon become uneaſie to the Mind, and often deſtructive to the Body; for a debauch of drinking makes moſt ſick and out of order af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and the enjoyment of handſom ill Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:38135:122"/>cauſes uſually foul Pocky Diſeaſes, (ſuch <hi>French</hi> puniſhment, ſuiting well with ſuch an <hi>Engliſh</hi> tranſgreſſion) for the fondneſs of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertuous Love placed on an unchaſt Womans beauty, is like the Fire of a Candle, which laſts no longer than it flames, and Candle like aſſoon as its flame is conſum'd, it preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires in a ſtinking ſnuff. So ſuch a debauch'd Love; (I ſhould have ſaid Luſt) commonly ends with the odious deteſting thoughts, of ſuch a foul and luſtful paſſion, which makes him then loath the ſinner, as he ought ſtill the ſin, and himſelf for having committed the folly.</p>
               <p>And if any one of theſe <hi>Venus</hi> Courtiers falls in Love with a truly vertuous Beauty, &amp; hopes to gain his baſe unchaſt deſires of her, by fierce Courtſhip, great adoration, large offers of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, &amp; all theſe thick larded with the common falſe Oaths of the praiſes of her great beauty, and his great and conſtant Love, the <hi>Lingua franca,</hi> of all Gallants which all ſtill ſwear to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, but few ever deſign to perform, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore handſom Ladies never ought to Credit; for ſurely he that ſpeaks what he does not believe, none ought to believe what he ſpeaks, but is bound in Conſcience and Honour, to ſlight his Courtſhip, and ſcorn his Offers, or elſe ſhe muſt do much worſe, ſlight her ſelf, and reputation too. 'Tis a Proverbial ſaying, <hi>that Love is blind,</hi> I am ſure ſuch a ſort of Lover is; for he will not ſee the unjuſt deſires he makes to her, but only
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:38135:123"/>minds the unkind returns ſhe makes to him, without ever conſidering that they ſpring from her Love to Vertue, and a good Reputation, but vainly fancies 'tis her Love to ſome happy Lover, that's in her favour, and keeps him out, which diſquiets and torments his Amorous mind, with a fierce Jealouſie, which <hi>Solomon</hi> calls <hi>the Rage of Love;</hi> and tho young Men are more naturally enflam'd with eager deſires in the purſuit of beauty, than old Men are; for Age to Love, is like Water to Wine, the more quantity of Water, the leſs ſtrength in the Wine; but tis moſt certain old Men are as able Courtiers, and Lovers of Wealth, as any young Men can poſſibly be; Riches being like the Sun, agreeable and comfortable to all, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing is more common, than to ſee Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs to grow in moſt with their Age; and the reaſon of it in my Opinion is, that all other youthful ſprightly delights but that of gaining Wealth, decreaſes as Age increaſes; but the pleaſure of Mony, all Men can keep as the Heathen do their Gods they adore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Lock and Key.</p>
               <p>But yet this ſo adored beauty, Riches, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries its troubles, as well as delights, for there's great labour in procuring Wealth, trouble in defending and preſerving it, and alſo great Cares in the well ſpending it whilſt one lives, and well diſpoſing of it when we die; and ſo if we look over, and ſearch into moſt Worldly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:38135:123"/>pleaſures and vanities, we ſhall find them as contrary to the true repoſe of this life, as they are to the felicities of the next.</p>
               <p>Certainly there is ſome great Charm in this thing called Praiſe, that tickles the ear, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames the heart, raiſes the ſpirits, enlivens the reſolution, deludes the reaſon, flatters the hopes, and deceives the ſight, by giving a falſe gloſs, and making a counterfeit repreſentation of things; for, the Bait of Praiſes, for which both Men and Women ſo ſtrive, and eagerly purſue, is ſtill painted and ſet out in the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt oriental charming Colours that are imaginable, to allure our eyes, inflame our hearts, and enliven our ambition.</p>
               <p>But the Hook that is hid in this Bait, that is, the great dangers, hardſhips, and thouſands of vexatious diſappointments, that one muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily meet, and run thorow, in the purſuit of this Idol folly, is ſo obſcure &amp; artificially drawn, as 'tis not commonly ſeen, but very ordinarily felt by many, in ſome to their loſs of Life, and to others of their greateſt ſatisfactions in it.</p>
               <p>And now to put my laſt finiſhing Touch to this Picture of Praiſe, the Miſtris and Darling of the whole World, methinks we ought not to wonder that this adored beauty, is ſo Coy in her Carriage, and ſo difficult to be gain'd; if we do but reflect, tho in a wholeſail manner, the ſad overſights, great miſtakes, and blind purſuits of its followers; of whom I ſhall only
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:38135:124"/>ſay in general, that ſome are ſo eager in gazing at it, others ſo over earneſt in their ſeeking it, as really moſt overſee the right way to it, which is by true Piety, conſtant Charity, and a daily practice of Vertue and Godlineſs in all their actions: And no wonder that ſuch as will not take theſe bleſſed Guides, ſhould mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably miſs their way to it, and be ſadly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated in their hopes of it.</p>
               <p>And now having done with my Diſcourſe of Praiſe, give me leave to change the Scene, and to paſs by the uncertainty of your meeting it, tho to reflect on the certainty of deaths meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, and the terrors that then appear at the end of a vain wicked life; and to beg the vain young Ladies Company for a little time, that I might lead their thoughts into the ſad and diſmal Regions of Mortality, that they may now conſider it, to prevent it hereafter from ſurprizing them, and that they may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their thoughts to the Grave, before their friends carry their Bodies.</p>
               <p>The Seaſons of our Lives reſemble exactly thoſe of the Year, the Summer of our Life ſwallows up the Spring of our Youth, and the Autumn of our Age makes us to decline, as the Sun does daily of its vigorous heat and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, till all the fair days, and various pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of natures beauty at laſt yeild to old Age Winter, as their Grave; for as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>'Tis appointed for every Man once to die,</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:38135:124"/>and one day is ſtill the death of the other; and tho many things may keep back the thoughts of deaths coming, yet nothing can retard the time of his approach.</p>
               <p>And now I muſt humbly beg our vain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Ladies pardon, if I here a little mind them of the ſad concluding Scene of their Life; and in how miſerable a condition ſome of them muſt neceſſarily be in when they come to die, and have waſted all their Life, in Vanity and Sin, little conſidering Reputation, and leſs fearing Scandal; little valuing Conſcience, and leſs eſteeming Eternity.</p>
               <p>It has often come into my mind, that the ſad end of ſuch vain Womens Lives, is like the laſt Scene of their Loves, to their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, which is juſt as an Ague turned upſide down, the cold fit after the hot; for when the fiery paſſions of youthful Love are changed through their Inconſtancy, or worn out by Age, or waſted by Sickneſs; for you know that Loves-vanity, is but of a ſhort date, it either vaniſhes in the act, and is nipped in its gay and vigorous bloſſom, like the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-leav'd Plants, by a cold Northern-wind; or elſe grows wrinkled and impotent, like crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deform'd ſhrubs, for want of fap and moiſture, and ſo grows loathſom and deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the grim Jaws of Death, that will too at laſt come with a dreadful ſtroak to level all our fair Cedars to the ground, and make your
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:38135:125"/>beauty (Ladies) to conſume away like a Moth fretting a Garment; every Woman is therefore but vanity: and when you are thus brought to your Death-beds of pain and languiſhing; O then Conſider what a ſad condition you muſt needs be in, when you will find all your fond beauty and vanity going off the Stage, when your life is juſt expiring, when the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts of your paſt vain life come to inflame your mind more fiercely, than the burning Feaver can your body, and that the remembrance of your paſt extravagant pride and vanity will torment your troubled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience more, than ever before they pleaſed your ſenſual appetite, and that the ſhivering fit of guilt, not only ſeizes your heart, but pierceth your very ſoul, with ſad and ſober thoughts of your paſt ſins, and the ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that you muſt ſoon give of them, and of the terrible puniſhments that you muſt juſtly ſuffer for them; when perhaps you cannot comfort your afflicted Conſcience with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of having ſo much as performed in your whole life one pious act, or charitable deed, when you had both time and means to have performed thouſands; and ſo as too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you do, loſe the bleſſings of the other World, meerly for ſlighting Gods mercies in this.</p>
               <p>And farther 'twill be well worth the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our vain Ladies, that when they lie a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:38135:125"/>dying, the ſins of their life will flie about their troubled minds, as naturally as ſparks do about fire, and will lighten them to a clear ſight of their pride and vanity; and their greateſt trouble when they are leaving this World, is what will become of them when they are out of it; and truly it will not be without great cauſe, ſince their Conſciences will then aſſure them, that their Bodily pain in this Life, will be but the Prologue or firſt ſtep to their Souls eternal miſery in the next.</p>
               <p>Whereas a pious young Lady who with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>David, makes a covenant with her Eyes that they ſhould not behold vanity, but obſerve Gods commandments as her chief ſtudy and delight;</hi> by truly living in his fear, ſhe will certainly die in his favour, and will find at her death, that her good Conſcience will be her real friend, and true comforter, and furniſh her with a chearful readineſs to ſubmit her will to Gods, which will never fail to protect her againſt all thoſe ſpiritual conflicts and temptations of Conſcience, which ſtill rack and torture ill Womens minds when they come to die; for tho God caſts her on her Bed of ſickneſs and pain, yet he will be ſure to lift her up with the arms of mercy; and bleſs her with the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a perfect ſtate of Bliſs, after her pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life is ended; for tho Death be the wages of Sin, yet a Pious death, is but the paſſage to a Heavenly Life. And a Religious vertuous
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:38135:126"/>Woman at her death will as certainly enter into a ſtate of eternal Felicity, as an impious vain and wicked one will into that of deſerved mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>That the fear of God is not only the beginning of wiſdom but the end of it;</hi> for it teacheth you to regulate your deſires, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie your actions, as it will make you live well, in order to die ſo. So that indeed our good actions concur in their influence towards the happineſs of our ſouls, as the Sun does in motion to the Dial; the Dial is not the true cauſe of the Suns motion to it, yet by the Suns ſhining on the Dial, you may truly Judge of the true motion of the Sun.</p>
               <p>But leaving aſide that diſpute whether good works can only merit Heaven, or not (as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> teach,) I am ſure living a pious vertuous life in the faith of the holy Jeſus, will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry you there; this all Ladies know, but few will practiſe, or ſo much as think of, I mean as you ought; for you uſually defer all thoughts of the other World, till you are juſt parting out of this, when alas the time preſent is only yours; for that paſt is no more, and that to come is not yet, ſo that you do but live between them both; the preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only time you can properly call yours, for God well knowing what great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals you are of it, is ſo providently merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as to truſt you only with a Minute at a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:38135:126"/>Time; for as he gives you one, ſo he ſtill takes away the other, as a Leſſon of inſtruction, not to rely on any time but the preſent, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all your Chriſtian duties in it, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly time appointed you by God for it. And Ladies if you will but employ this preſent time as you ought, you will certainly find time enough in it, to enjoy both the delights of this World, and to ſecure you the felicities of the next.</p>
               <p>By this all our vain Ladies may eaſily know, and joyfully conclude, that there needs no great difficulty in obtaining Heaven, ſince it only requires, (as I have told you) a ſtrict pious and vertuous life to compaſs it; which may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be done, if you will but ſpend half ſo much time in ſerving your God, as you daily waſt in looking on your Glaſs; in praying for your Soul, as in ſetting out your Face, which muſt certainly, nay perhaps ſuddenly, ſtink, rot, and be eaten up by naſty Worms. And real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſing there was no ſuch place of Bliſs, as Heaven for the Godly, nor yet of Torment, as Hell for the wicked; yet a pious vertuous life, cannot but be more healthful for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and more ſatisfactory to the mind, than exceſs, pride and vanity, can be to either.</p>
               <p>Next 'tis worth your conſideration to think, how little true content moſt of you can find in this World, and how little time 'tis you can enjoy that little you do deſire; for ſuch
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:38135:127"/>conſiderations cannot but render you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſenſible, of your great and extravagant folly in all your ludicrous ſports and paſtimes, unskilfully gaming away your ſouls; ſo as in a manner to ſet Eternity againſt a Moment, I mean, the Momentary pleaſures of this life, which cannot laſt, before the joys of Heaven, which are everlaſting; and ſure there can be nothing more fooliſh than to rely on the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your abode on Earth, as any ſolid and laſting poſſeſſion, there being nothing more frail and tottering than the Baſis your life ſtands on; for tho you are never ſo healthful, yet you cannot but find in your ſelf, ſome marks and ſymptoms of Mortality, which may ſerve as Advertiſements of the inſtability of this your earthly being, which is ſubject to a thouſand Diſeaſes, and a torrent of Accidents, eſpecially in you fine young Ladies, whoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are ſo tenderly built, and nicely compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as the leaving off a Hood, or wanting of a Skarf; the leaſt crum of Bread, that ſticks in your Throats, or the ſmalleſt ſtop in the courſe of your Blood, (I had almoſt ſaid or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Tongues) puts the whole O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of your body in diſorder, if not utter ruin, witneſs as an inſtance of this accidental mortality, Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> who as ſtory ſays, <hi>was choaked with a Flie;</hi> nay your very food, the ſupport and maintainet of your life, ought to be a <hi>Memorandum</hi> of your Mortality, ſince
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:38135:127"/>you cannot live without it; and if ſleep be the Image of death, you are by the very neceſſities of your nature, to die every night, during the few days you live.</p>
               <p>But whether you live long, or die early, you muſt certainly Die; and you are in this as well as in all things elſe, to ſubmit your will to Gods, and to bend your greateſt endeavors, and fix your ſtrongeſt reſolutions, in an intire obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nce to it, which if you truly and heartily do, you muſt learn the great vertue, and Chriſtian perfection of ſelf-denial, and deſpiſe all thoſe worldly flatteries and enjoyments; mortifie all your exceſs of vanity and extravagant plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that you may become truly amiable pure and holy in the ſight of God; when you live in compliance to his holy Laws, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in all things to his good will and pleaſure, who is all love and beauty it ſelf, in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt meaſure and perfection; and therefore the leaſt ſpot or impurity in your lives, is a direct violence and contradiction to the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent nature, and being of an infinitely pure and holy God.</p>
               <p>And now before I quite finiſh this Diſcourſe let me beg one of you Ladies, to ſuppoſe your' ſelf to be in the actual poſſeſſion of all the worldly pleaſures you can fancy, that you enjoy as great honours as your ambition can aſpire unto, and as much Beauty, and Riches, as your vain and Covetous humor can thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:38135:128"/>and as many rarities as your appetite can wiſh for, and that your Gallant was as kind, handſom and conſtant as you could wiſh: In a word, that you thought him as beautiful, as you think your ſelf; pray do but now conſider, what all theſe will amount to, at the hour of death, and in order to it, reflect a little ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, what a weak Baſis your life ſtands on; for according to the common Law of the Land, a Life is valued but at ſeven Years purchaſe, and many times by the courſe of Nature, a Life does not laſt half ſo long.</p>
               <p>Next if you will but condeſcend ſo far to mortifie your ſelf, as to go and viſit one of theſe Lovers of vanity, and railliers of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, one of theſe coyneſſes of folly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers of vertue, lying ſick on her Death-bed, paſt all hopes of recovery; and do but obſerve how her Words and Looks are changed, and indeed the whole Scene of her Life, her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance being all ſhadow'd over with the pale and diſmal Colours of Mortality, inſtead of her gay Vermillion paint; for all beauty and worldly delights vaniſh and leave you with your health, being like a Sun Dial, only uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whilſt the Sun ſhines on it; then you ſhall find the but naming her rich Diamond Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and fine Pearl Necklace, her Embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Gowns, and Coſtly Points, will prove troubleſom to her, and the ſight or ſmell of her late beloved Dainties will then loath her Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:38135:128"/>nay a viſit of her dear Gallant, whom ſhe was ſo fond of, and delighted in, will be odious to her ſight, as well as the thoughts of having too much lov'd him, will be grievous to her mind: Then her Bottles of White-waſhes, or Coſmeticks will be thrown out, and filled with ſhowers of penitent Tears for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving uſed them: Then her Boxes of Peeter, and Patches, and all her Ornamental knacks and dreſſes, ſhe was wont every day to waſt ſo much time about, and to take ſo great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime in, to adorn and ſet out her beauty, will only ſerve to diſquiet her thoughts, and the Praiſes of her beauty, will be but ſo many diſturbances in her Sickneſs, and ſhe will be then as much troubled to hear them, as ſhe was formerly delighted to receive them, and proud in the vain thoughts of deſerving them.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, on her Death bed, all her late dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved Vanities, will at that time appear her moſt afflicting Enemies; and ſhe will then loudly declare, that nothing but a religious Life, can produce a Comfortable death; and will then tell you, that if ſhe were the ſole Miſtris of all the Riches of both the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſhe would give it all for the bleſſing of a good Conſcience; for that never leaves one, in Sickneſs, or in Adverſity, but is ſtill the beſt of Friends, in the worſt of times.</p>

               <p>I Humbly beg the vain Ladies pardon for beginning this Diſcourſe ſo uncivilly, as to tell them, 'tis the Opinion of moſt ſober and obſerving Men, that many of you make but a ſelf-deceiving Calculation in the account of your Chriſtian duties, and holy performances; by fancying your ſelves well ſecured, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently active, in the exerciſe of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and in your obedience to him, if you do but riſe early enough on Sunday to go to Church in the Morning, and can Dine ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately as not to ſleep at the Sermon in the Afternoon, and do ſay a kind of ſizd Prayer like a ſhort Grace of a few cuſtomary words, riſing and going to bed all the week after, which perhaps may be ſaid more out of long habit, than true devotion.</p>
               <p>How many Ladies are there, and thoſe of a good and ſober ſort, (as Women go now adays) that fancy becauſe they live Chaſt, read the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:38135:129"/>Bible now and then, and miſs going to Church but ſeldom, who are Charitable to the Poor, Loving to their Neighbours, true to their Friends, good will to all, and in love with none, (unleſs may be a little with themſelves,) think they perform all Chriſtian duties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and therefore deſerve all Mens Praiſes truly; and indeed they would not think amiſs, if they would be but near as juſt and exact to God in their daily account of their time to him, as they are in creating daily freſh paſtimes and pleaſures to themſelves, and that they would meaſure out their time, according to Goſpel Precepts, inſtead of imploying it in vain <hi>London</hi> follies and paſtimes, which among the modiſh Ladies, are partly thoſe:</p>
               <p>So many hours for Dreſſing, ſo many hours for receiving and returning Viſits, ſo many for the Play, and the Park, ſo many hours for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at this friends houſe, Supping with that, and playing late at Cards at t'others, or being at a publick Ball or Dancing at anothers, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours to ſleep a Bed to ſatisfie Nature, ſo many more to lie a Bed, to continue their full Face, and good Looks; beſides hours for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Court, to ſee new faſhions, and ranſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Shops to buy new-faſhioned Silks and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, beſides other times of vain idleneſs and prodigality of exceſs and folly; as ſuch a great part of the Year for a pretended Diſeaſe, or rather diverſion at the <hi>Bath,</hi> ſuch a ſeaſon for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:38135:130"/>an infirmity, or recreation at the Wells of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> or <hi>Epſom;</hi> to raffle away it may be our time and money, to be profuſe, and game at publick Lotteries, or to charm or decoy ſome rich Heir, or Gallant for next Winters ſervice; and now <hi>Ladies,</hi> when all theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent hours are abſtracted out of the twenty four, beſides other parts of your lives accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; I am afraid you will find ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and ill management of your time, as you do often too ſenſibly of your Eſtates and Money, and ſo miſerably condole thoſe loſt Minutes which you might have employed to better purpoſes, in being ſoberly modeſt and pious, to have performed the duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is the only true pleaſure and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime of the ſoul: And tho ſome of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements I know are not barely in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſinful crimes, yet ſure they are no better than venial ſins, by their totally taking up, and ſo intirely devouring of young Womens whole time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. My firſt Advice therefore to the vain La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, is to alter the miſpending of their time as now they do, to employ it as really as they ought to do; which is in preparing to die well, rather than ſtriving to live high, or look fair, and not to fancy they ſpend their time well, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch as they but loſe it with; for as <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> ſays, <hi>They are idle, who might be better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed;</hi> ſo ſuch Ladies live in ſome kind ill, that may live in many degrees better.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:38135:130"/>
               <p>Therefore as prudent Men manage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate their Eſtates, by dividing it into ſeveral proportions; ſo much for Houſe keeping, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants wages, Apparel, private expences, and the like; and ſo ſuiting their Income, to anſwer their ſeveral Charges, according to their ability to perform, as their occaſions require; which neceſſary Meaſures, becauſe many of the young Eſtated Men will not obſerve, they ſteer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Compaſs, run they know not where, ſpend they know not what, and live they know not how, extravagantly, without eaſe or order.</p>
               <p>Now Ladies to prevent ſuch an extravagant manner of ſpending, or rather waſting of your time, I ſhall adviſe you in order to the well managing of it, not only to divide it into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hours, for that is already done to your hand, by many good Clocks and Watches; but you muſt ſubdivide the hours of the day, into ſo many portions ſet out for devotion, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and paſtime, according to your ability, and conveniency, always giving place to the duties of Religion, the firſt and principal part in all your deſigns, and actions; ſtill beginning the day with Prayer, and praiſes to your Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; who made both it, and you, in order to your worſhiping and ſerving him, and by ſo dividing the day into ſo many ſeveral parts, and Stages of hourly employments, the changeable variety that's in them, will afford you variety of pleaſure, as well as buſineſs, to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:38135:131"/>entertain and direct you, and prevent you La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from complaining, as I have heard many of you, O what ſhall we do to paſs away this afternoon, ſince you will ſee all the days buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and divertiſments marked out before you; and really nothing more diſtracts and vitiates vain young Womens minds, than emptineſs of buſineſs and employment, the want of which fills you up with the ill vapours of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that old Mother of wickedneſs, whereas certain hourly employments, fill and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh your fancy with ſuch diverſity of change, and buſineſs, as is able to ſuppreſs, and allay, all fumes of vain idle thoughts, from ariſing in your minds, and ſave you the expenſive trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of imitating many of the fine gay modiſh Ladies, who by chargeable means and ſtudied Arts, purchaſe ways vainly to paſs away their time, which by the courſe of nature, without their help, and beyond their power, runs away but too faſt of it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My next Advice to the vain Ladies, tho I am ſure 'tis very good, yet I doubt 'twill be little lik'd, and leſs follow'd; which is to ſhun the infectious temptations of a vain <hi>London</hi> life, which often gets many young Ladies bad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, but ſeldom good Husbands. <hi>London</hi> being become the very Center point, and Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous, where all the vices and vanites of the Kingdom meet; yet theſe vices and vanities, are among many of the fine Ladies, ſo richly
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:38135:131"/>gilt, finely painted, and ſplendedly ſet out, as they are ſo far from appearing deformed, as they ſeem beautiful and taking to moſt, I mean the inconſidering young Men of the Town.</p>
               <p>Really the Air of <hi>London</hi> is ſo infected with Pride, Vanity, and Idleneſs, that 'tis hard for one of you young Ladies to appear in young Mens Company, but you muſt have your Ears furr'd with Oaths and Profaneneſs, or elſe your perſon Complemented with vain Romantick Courtſhip, which is not exactly applied and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for any one Woman, but for all handſom Women in general; like falſe flattering Looking Glaſſes, which Complements not only one, but every one that looks on them, not ſtaying for a great beauty, but ſtill flattering the firſt comer.</p>
               <p>But Piety and Vertue is ſtill like a pure wholeſom Air, a comfort to all, and an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to none, and is ſo far from diſlodging, or overcaſting the lightſomneſs of any lawful pleaſures, as it clears and diſſipates any dark Clouds of fears that may hang over them; for 'tis moſt certain, Piety and Beauty, Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Devotion, may live peaceably together, and yield a mutual aid and comfort to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>Indeed if you Ladies would but uſe to mix Piety with your paſtimes, you would ſoon come to make a paſtime of Piety; and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:38135:132"/>of dividing the hours for vain <hi>London</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, you would make them ſo many <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randums</hi> of the eflux of time, to put you in mind of the duties of Mortality, and of the hourly advances you make towards it, which requires hourly preparations for it; for the ſame hours ſerve as well to tell you of your approaches to Death, as to divide your pleaſures in Life, as the ſame Figures in your Watch ſerve to tell the hours of the night, as well as thoſe of the day.</p>
               <p>Then Ladies you will find that time laid out in Prayer and Devotion, is not ſpending, but gaining time; and if you will but ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, and heartily practiſe this great Truth; you will ſoon find, that Piety is as to advancing of worldly delights, and paſtimes, but as Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt to a Ship, which does not hinder, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regulate its motion, not flackning but ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying its Sayling.</p>
               <p>A fine Lady whoſe mind is only fraighted with the Airy Cargo of pride and vanity, can never ſteer ſteddy in her heavenly Courſe; but is ſtill toſſed from one ſide of folly, to another extremity of vanity, for the want of the true bleſſed Ballaſt of godlineſs, which will Calm and diſpoſſeſs your mind of all modiſh vanities, and irregularities, and will allay all kinds of immoderate heats, raiſed by the Feaveriſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of Womaniſh Paſſions, and will fix your affection on what is immovable, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:38135:132"/>and will ſoon cauſe you to abandon the vain empty undurable paſtimes of <hi>London,</hi> for the true endleſs felicity of Heaven, <hi>and this is a Heaven upon Earth, To love God, and keep his Commandments;</hi> for then you will truly love Vertue, and conſtantly practiſe Piety, and only delight in the beauty of holineſs; which as it tranſcends much, ſo it differs far from, all Earthly love, for that's ſeldom or never enjoyed with true quietneſs, long ſatisfaction, or juſt and equal returns; for the moſt paſſionate Love we can fancy, as a Miſtris to her Gallant, or a Gallant to his Miſtris, is commonly of ſo fickle, volatile, and inconſtant a nature, as if a Woman thinks her Gallant loves any other Woman, ſhe grows Jealous; and if he fancies his Miſtris loves another Man, (as 'tis ten to one ſhe does) he becomes inrag'd, for as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.34. <hi>Jealouſie is the rage of a Man,</hi> here on Earth tho moſt are Lovers, yet many are falſe ones, but in Heaven all are Lovers, and are true ones; ſince in your Heavenly Love, your act of loving, is the certain fruition of your Love: a Woman by loving Vertue, it becomes hers, but by loving a Gallant you become his; for ſhe that is under a Gallants command, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not truly ſay ſhe is under her own. In a word, all the Riches and Pleaſures imaginable, that you abandon for the love of God, you enjoy them all, in loving God above them all.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:38135:133"/>
               <p>And you may be certain Ladies, if you can but thus love God as you ought, you muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the World as you ſhould, and then you will take more true delight in the title of a good Chriſtian, than you did ever before in the vain praiſe of a great beauty, and ſlight this, in compariſon of that, for a handſom Woman like the Sun, is to be eſteemed more for her Vertue, than Splendor. Beauty is but a fine outſide Skin, but true Godlineſs is all glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous within, and will beſtow on you more Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial beauty in the other World, than all your falſe Glaſſes, and Gallants falſer Tongues, can flatter you with in this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. My next advice to your vain Ladies is, when you are putting on your fine rich Gowns which ſo many of you adorn your ſelves with every day, with ſo great care, high exceſs, and vaſt expence, as well of time, as mony, which makes many of you by being ſo over careful in ſetting out your body, to be over careleſs in looking after your Soul, in not allowing it perhaps ſo much as a clean ſhift of Repentance once a Sunday, I mean a penitent Sigh or Tear in a Week, to blow off, and waſh away your Sins, and Vanities, which your own corrupt Natures, and idle Company breeds in you every day: Therefore when you are putting on your new rich Gowns, if you could but remember at the ſame time, to Lace about your hearts this <hi>Memorandum</hi> of the Prophet,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:38135:133"/>
                  <hi>That Worms are breeding under your Covering;</hi> doubtleſs ſuch mortifying reflexions, would humble your pride, and abate your vanity; and not only hinder you from leading ſuch vain Lives, but wearing ſuch rich Clothes, which though they may exactly ſuit with the Rules of the Modiſts; yet I am ſure 'tis quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Precepts of the Apoſtle, <hi>who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Women not to adorn themſelves with rich, but modeſt Apparel,</hi> as if rich Apparel, was not modeſt, nor to uſe painful Dreſſes, which is an exceſs of folly of another kind, by ſqueezing your ſelves into a fine ſlender ſhape, by pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and thereby tormenting of your bodies, by laſing your ſelves ſo ſtreight to take Mens ſight, as you can hardly take your own breath; and if this be not great pride, and high folly, I confeſs I know not what is.</p>
               <p n="4">4. My next adviſe to the vain Ladies, which (I am ſure) is of great uſe, and high advantage, in order to their living vertuouſly, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing religiouſly, is this: Not only to ſhun, but totally to baniſh that familiar companion of your Sex, Pride; I ſhall not ſtrive here to dive far into the depth of this vaſt Ocean of iniquity; though all our actions run as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to it, as Rivers do to the Sea: Nor do I here pretend to make a ſubtile penetration, into any hard Conceptions of the ſinful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and wicked conſequences of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, (I had almoſt ſaid Womaniſh) Vice of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:38135:134"/>Pride, my deſign being not to enlarge on it, but only to preſent you with ſome plain uſeful advices, and directions how to deſtroy, or at leaſt Countermine this raging Sin, which muſt be done by a common practice of humility; which if young Women would but conſider truly, and follow carefully, it would ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, to lay aſide their <hi>Delilah</hi> Creature of vanity, and to call in a more vertuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of humility, and make her their boſom friend; for Pride is one of the ſeven Sins <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us God abominates, and <hi>Scripture</hi> aſſures you, <hi>That God ſtill rebuketh the Proud, and ever giveth grace to the humble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pride is now turned into a Cancerous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor very apt to grow in all young handſom Womens breſts, and in moſt it ſwells and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, ſo as to become noyſom, not only to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and piety, but indeed to very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Society; and 'tis eaſie to obſerve, that many handſom Women, whom Nature hath preſented with a large proportion of beauty, which of it ſelf had been able to render them agreeable, and taking to all perſons; yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them do ſo fully and overcaſt the glory of it with Pride, and ſelf conceitedneſs, as to give it a diſagreeable Air, and reliſh to moſt of its admirers, by their too apparent proud affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eſtimation of it. And 'tis obſervable Ladies, that ſuch of you as are always ready to place too high a value on your ſelves, are ſtill apt to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:38135:134"/>caſt too low an eſteem on others, and ſo cauſe moſt to undervalue you, for your ſlighting them. Whereas the vertue of true humility, aſcends by the means of deſcending, as Trees mount and flouriſh upward, by rooting and growing downward.</p>
               <p>Pride is a diſtemper of the mind, which moſt young Ladies are naturally inclined to, and eaſily infected with; for the leaſt enflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their beauty by Praiſes, preſently turns to the filthy ulcer of pride, which is of ſuch an extraordinary malignant nature, as low birth, little wit, no beauty, great want, nay very ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs it ſelf, is not a ſufficient Cure and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt it; <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Want of Bread will not ſtarve Pride,</hi> and I am ſure experience reacheth us, that want of beauty, will not ſtarve ſome Womens proud fancies of being handſom, tho they have not the leaſt feature of it; ſo over-apt are young Women to believe themſelves ſo, that if Men will be ſo great ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars as to tell them they are beautiful, they will be ſo great Fools as to believe them, and rather credit other Mens words, than their own Eyes; ſure Women ſo blinded, ought above all things to beg of our bleſſed Saviour, as the blind Man did in the <hi>Goſpel, Lord grant me my ſight, that they might clearly come to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their own folly and uglineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sure 'twould be impoſſible that handſom Women, could ſo delight in this Deviliſh ſin of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:38135:135"/>Pride, if they would but remember, that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is as well a certain improvement of beauty, as a conſtant inhabitant with vertue; for humility makes a little beauty appear great, but Pride makes a great beauty to appear lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; the firſt being taking to all, the ſecond odious to every one: The more beauty a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous young Lady has, the leſs pride ſhe will ſhew, like a Pyramid, that ſtill leſſens as it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and as a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſaid, <hi>He is a brave Man indeed, whoſe wealth, honour, and power, makes the leaſt part of his greatneſs;</hi> ſo that young Lady is a real perfect beauty indeed, that makes the handſomneſs of her face, the leaſt pride or concern of her mind; ſo vaſt a difference there is between the vertue of the Soul, and the beauty of the Face; as <hi>Seneca</hi> well obſerves, <hi>That Vertue is the only Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal thing that belongs to Mortality,</hi> and we may alſo well obſerve, that the beauty of the Face is the moſt fading thing that belongs to frailty. Methinks our proud Ladies ought to remember the humility of <hi>David,</hi> who though a great King, was yet ſo humble as to ſtile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>a Worm and no Man,</hi> but moſt of our ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated beauties, are ſo far from the humble thoughts of eſteeming themſelves Worms and no Women, as they are ſo highly proud, and ridiculouſly fooliſh, that like the <hi>Babel</hi> proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, they hope to Toure themſelves as high as the Heavens; for ſome of them fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:38135:135"/>to be Stars of the firſt Magnitude, a kind of Goddeſſes raiſed up to the Skie; but if you ask me how, I can but tell you, they were only raiſed there by the lofty Muſe of their own vain imagination; and therefore ſuch proud puft up beauties, are really but like your School-boys Paper-Kytes, which are only mounted into the Skie, by the Wind, and fall to the ground again aſſoon as it ceaſes to blow them up.</p>
               <p>Really if I durſt venture to give my free vote as to my opinion of beauty, I ſhould tell the Ladies that I think 'tis a meaſuring caſt, and a diſputable Queſtion, which is moſt unſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and unlaſting, either the matter of this fine compoſition called beauty, which is in the handſomeſt Woman but like the fading co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a <hi>Tulip,</hi> only pleaſant to the Eye; for a little time, and there's all; or the maker of it, which is no other than the various opinion of every gazers inclination, beauty having almoſt as many Fathers, as there are Men Judges of it.</p>
               <p>Surely theſe vain proud Creatures have read the Story of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prince, who was raiſed to be Emperor for his good Face; and therefore think they may well hope to be raiſed not only to an Empire over Men for their great beauty, but that they do well deſerve a great tranſcendency over the ordinary rate of Women-kind, but indeed ſuch high beauties are at very beſt, but like Meteors, which are
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:38135:136"/>exhaled but a little above the Earth, and are yet a great deal below the Heavens.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe I ſhould be ſo highly Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental as to allow theſe great beauties, the full Swing, and extravagant range of their own vain proud and lofty fancies; that they are as far above the ordinary ſort of Women, as the Skie is above the Earth, and that their motions were very generous and ſublime, imitating the Sea, which impatient to be confined by the bounds which God has given, is ſtill ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſtriving to mount and raiſe it ſelf above the ſurface of the Earth; yet I would gladly learn, becauſe I can no way fancy how they will pretend to be begot there, except it be by the Man in the Moon; and indeed that may poſſibly be ſome reaſon, why our great beauties are generally ſo fickle and inconſtant in their Love, as receiving their great mutability from the influence of the Moon, as their immediate Parent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Therefore my next Advice to the vain Ladies, is ſtill to remember that though your beauties may be extraordinary, yet your lives can never be Immortal on Earth; and that your great beauty, and proud thoughts, muſt both periſh with you; for it may be truly ſaid of great beauties, what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaid of great Princes, <hi>Though you are ſtiled Gods, yet you muſt die like Men;</hi> ſo <hi>though you may be called Goddeſſes, yet you muſt die like Women;</hi> and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:38135:136"/>though your beauty could make as great a Conqueſt of hearts, as ever <hi>Alexander</hi> did of Kingdoms, who had no more to ſubdue; yet as death has certainly put a period, to his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and life; ſo he will certainly do the like, to your beauty and days.</p>
               <p>For indeed the greateſt beauty, is but like the fineſt Glaſs, the more clear, the more frail, and eaſily broken; for alas, take beauty in its very higheſt Altitude, and greateſt vigour, 'tis a fabrick compoſed, and made up of ſo many tender pieces of ſuch brittle ware, and delicate Contexture, as the leaſt ſpot or flaw, in any one part, ſpoils, or at leaſt blemiſhes the luſtre of the whole; and as the Poet ſays,
<q>
                     <l>One that is all over Heart,</l>
                     <l>Every place proves a Mortal part.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now Ladies if you reſolve to be all over vertuous, and diſcreet in Reputation, ſo as to live Shot-free, from all the wounding Darts of cenſure, you muſt arm your ſelves with a clear and innocent complexion of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; to procure which, you muſt not only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from evil, but the very appearance of it, not only from doing bad Actions, and keeping ill Company, but even the hearing, much leſs receiving vain praiſes; and as you ought to ſhew a general civility to all, ſo you ought not to give a particular freedom to any.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:38135:137"/>
               <p>In a word, you muſt manage all your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with a ſtrict prudence, a perfect modeſty, a real humility, a vertuous behaviour, and a conſtant fear of God in all you ſay and do, and theſe will gain you praiſes, and make you well deſerve to be admired; for <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.30. <hi>'Tis the Woman that feareth God ſhall be praiſed,</hi> and by ſuch a bleſſed and holy kind of life, you will ſecure your ſelf againſt all the Cenſorious talk of envious bablers, againſt the venom of thoſe lying malicious Tongues, who are not fit to be believed, nor worthy to be feared.</p>
               <p>Indeed Ladies, the beſt way to make your earthly beauty, continue good and laſting, is to be humble in your own thoughts, and not to pride, or value your ſelves more than you ought; ſince 'tis ſo vain, and uncertain in its moſt lovely colours and complexion; for this will give Men a juſt admiration of your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and modeſty, and preſerve the vertue of it Immortal, beyond the duration of this fair and naked ſubſtance, which ſome ſudden acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or diſeaſe can ſoon blaſt and rob of all its blooming and youthful vigour, ſtrip it of all its gay attirement, and you of that vain delight in your own ſelf-admiration; ſo then beauty is only leſs commendable in her, who makes it her only pride and concern to ſet it off; and ſuch a Lady, thus trigg'd up, and furniſhed out, by great art and invention, by glittering apparel
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:38135:137"/>and proud oſtentation, is but like a fire of Straw, it may blaze much, but it cannot laſt long, and whilſt it lights others, it conſumes it ſelf. But a handſom Lady that's free from affectation and pride, and is bleſſed with great Piety, and true Humility, is like the Heavenly fire in <hi>Moſes</hi> Buſh, which burnt and lighted others, and yet never conſum'd it ſelf.</p>
               <p>A handſom woman that is very proud, does but enjoy her beauty, as the Miſer does his Wealth, who does not ſo much poſſeſs it, as it poſſeſſes him; and therefore your truly pious Ladies, do but uſe their worldly beauty, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays <hi>we are to uſe this World, that is, as if we uſed it not,</hi> by a godly habit of mind, conſuming all the uſual vanity affected by others in the pious reflection, that there's no true vertue, or durable ſatisfaction in it.</p>
               <p>We read in <hi>Geneſis</hi> that good old <hi>Abraham,</hi> made no other uſe of all his wealth, than to purchaſe him a Grave; O why ſhould not all proud Women imitate him, and though they be never ſo rich in beauty, employ it all in Purchaſing a Grave of Humility, to bury the duſt of their Pride in; and by ſo doing, they will certainly find a Reſurrection of true Glory out of it, which will raiſe to them Garlands of perpetual Praiſes, of ſo Heavenly a nature, and vaſt an extent, as they will as much excel all the falſe vain glittering ſplendor of this World, as the noon day brightneſs, of a Summers Sun,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:38135:138"/>does the ſmall glimmering light of a little Glow-worm, which cannot be ſeen, but by the help of darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I ſhall next adviſe the vain Ladies, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to new mould their Lives in this Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al frame of Reformation, and to ſquare out all their actions by the Golden Rules of Piety and Vertue. I heard of a Gentleman that being dangerouſly ill of a Dropſie, went to a famous Phyſician for his Advice, who bid him abſtain from all Drink for a Twelve Month, and it would Cure him: I am confident the like kind of Remedy would cure the fine Ladies, let them but abſtain from all vain thoughts on themſelves, and not hearken to the vain flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and praiſes of others but for one Year, and 'twill certainly cure them of that Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh diſtemper of Pride; for by one Twelve Months baniſhing it, and converſing only with vertue and humility, which are inſeparable friends, they will certainly make them ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly prudent, and happily vertuous, as to hate and ſhun all proud deſires, and flatterers Praiſes, and cauſe them to love only thoſe that Court them in the holy Language of Truth, to the Love of Godlineſs; which is the very beſt way, they can expreſs their Love to you, or you your Love to your ſelves; and truly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies I cannot ſee the leaſt reaſon, why you ſhould be againſt this holy change, ſince it will not be a parting with, nor ſo much as a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:38135:138"/>Retrenching of your love delights, but rather be a better means, to enlarge and improve them, by placing and fixing your mind, on a much more noble object, and a far finer enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, by tranſplanting your affections, into a far richer ſoil, from Earth to Heaven; from the fading vanities of this World, to the never decaying felicities of the next; and when once a young Ladies Inclinations are firmly rooted in a real deſire and hearty endeavour for this bleſſed Change, ſhe will ſoon find that her Love will become ſo piouſly purified, that inſtead of her fixing it on mortal Man, ſhe will only dedicate it to the ſervice of the ever living God, whoſe ſervice is ſtill true happineſs, and perfect freedom.</p>
               <p>Then ſuch a Lady will be happy above the low Region of all worldly flatterers and the more vain concerns of a fading beauty, ſhe'll not value the rallying ſcoffs and contempts of thoſe who deride her humble and ſtrict de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, now ſo much out of faſhion among the vain Ladies of our times; for ſuch a reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lady, whoſe mind is truly ſanctified, will extract uſes of vertue, out of ſuch extravagant Womens vanities, like the Bee, that ſucks Hony out of all ſorts of venomous Herbs, and like Fire, that turns all things within its compaſs to its ſelf; and ſuch a Ladies holy courſe of Life, will be ſteady and certain in its progreſs like the Sun in his daily motion,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:38135:139"/>nothing of Storms or changable weather, can ever haſten, or retard its regular courſe; for a Lady that's in the holy ſtate of true Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, her conſtant Piety will ſo purifie and draw off her inclinations from all vain paſtimes and modiſh vanities, and from thoſe foul dregs of impurity, that are the uſual attendants of a vain idle <hi>London</hi> Life, that by this Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration of Mind, and pious habit of Life; her Converſation will be as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays, <hi>fixed up in Heaven,</hi> and we all know that the upper Region of the Air it ſelf, will admit of no Storms or Thunder, for they are all formed below it.</p>
               <p>And farther that Lady who is ſo bleſſed as to have her heart touch'd with this Magnetic vertue of true godlineſs, her thoughts will be elevated to ſuch a heavenly pitch of ſpiritual vertue and religion, as ſhe will deſpiſe all the young Gallants fine words, deep ſighs, and languiſhing looks, with all their high Praiſes, and ſhowers of Complements, which will work no more on her ſanctified Mind, than ſhowers of Hail on the tops of well covered Houſes, which fall off, as ſoon as it falls on, without ever touching any of the inward part.</p>
               <p>And whereas our vain Ladies receive the extravagant encomiums and flatteries, I might have almoſt ſaid Adorations, of their vain Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants as the Lawful Iſſue of their own applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:38135:139"/>Merit; a truly pious Lady, will only hearken to all the Airy Praiſes young Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to her beauty, to be but the Baſtard brood, of their own abundant ſin, and folly, and ſhe will make ſuch pious reflections on ſuch young Mens overmuch praiſes, grounded on a ſenſe of her own unworthineſs of them, as ſhe will not only deſpiſe their extravagant ſpeeches, but themſelves for ſpeaking of them; which doubtleſs cannot but be very acceptable to God the ſearcher of all hearts, <hi>who ſtill giveth grace to the humble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore Ladies, if you really deſire true piety and humility, I muſt adviſe you again, and again, never to hearken with delight, or hear with belief, or indeed ſuffer with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but ſhun with diligence, young Mens airy praiſes and Complements, nor yet coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance their flatteries; for multitude of Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes cannot but perplex young Ladies Minds, as many Lights ſtill confound the Sight; and therefore when you hear young Men give their Tongues ſuch looſe liberties, and over large ranges, in magnifying your beauty, remember ſuch high Complemental expreſſions are to be truſted no more, than the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Flag of a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pyrat, which he only hangs out, that you might eſteem him your friend, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may make you become his Slave.</p>
               <p>Therefore Ladies keep ſtill about you this preſervative of your vertue, that you look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:38135:140"/>on all the vain Gallants, that Court you with high Complements, and great praiſes, to be but ſo many <hi>Judas</hi>'s that come to betray you with a kiſs, and do not believe their Oaths, either on the account of what they ſwear, as to your great beauty, or their own true Love; for really flattery and vain praiſes, are now grown ſuch common Arts, among fond Lovers, as well as great States-men, and Complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Courtiers, as we often meet the truth of their meaning, in the contradiction of their words.</p>
               <p n="7">7. My laſt concluding adviſe to the vain modiſh Ladies is, when one of you is curiouſly beholding and admiring your fine Face in your Glaſs, and find that the great beauty of it, raiſes proud thoughts in your heart, (which is almoſt as common among handſom Ladies, as 'tis for them to look in their Glaſs, which nothing can be more common) humble your pride with theſe mortifying reflections, that this very fine Face of yours, that you like ſo much, love ſo well, and are ſo taken with, and fond of, muſt unavoidably in a little time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come loathſom, rottenneſs, ſtink, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, turn odious either to be ſeen or ſmelt, which is as very certain, as mortality it ſelf; and death you know is not only ſure to meet you, but your are expoſed by a thouſand accidents to meet it, whilſt you are travelling in this Earthly Pilgrimage; for the ſpritely gaiety of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:38135:140"/>your bloſſom youth, can only let you know how long you may poſſibly live, but can give no advance ſecurity how long you certainly will; therefore young Ladies as well as old Men ought ſtill to march under the ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a vertuous Life, and not to truſt to the temptation of a long Life, but to rely only on the bleſſed ſecurity of a good one.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this Diſcourſe and Book with the good ſaying of an excellent religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, <hi>That the vaineſt beauty on Earth, cannot juſtly deny this great Truth, that beauty is not abſolutely neceſſary to the good of this Life, but that Piety is eſſentially neceſſary both to the good of this Life, and the next too, ſince one may live well, without beauty, but one can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther live or die well without Piety.</hi>
